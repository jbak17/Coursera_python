Committee met at 08:35. 

CHAIR  (Senator  Dastyari):    I  declare  open  the  first  hearing  of  the  inquiry  of  the  Senate  Economics 
References Committee into digital currency. The Senate referred this inquiry to the committee on 2 October 2014 
for report by 2 March 2015. The committee has received six submissions, which are available on the committee's 
website. The closing date for submissions is this Friday. I am aware of a few others that are coming. I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank those who made submissions to the inquiry and witnesses who have taken the 
time to appear before the committee today.  

These  are  public  proceedings,  although  the  committee  may  determine,  or  agree  to  a  request,  to  have  the 
evidence heard in camera. I remind all witnesses that in giving evidence to the committee they are protected by 
parliamentary privilege.  It  is unlawful for anyone  to threaten or disadvantage a witness on account of evidence 
given to a committee and such action may be treated by the Senate as a contempt. It is also a contempt to give 
false or misleading evidence to the committee.  If a witness objects to answering a question, the witness should 
state the grounds upon which the objection is taken and the committee will determine whether it will insist on an 
answer, having regard to the grounds claimed. If the committee determines to insist on an answer, a witness may 
request that the answer be given in camera. Such a request may of course also be made at any other time.  

I welcome Mr Mark Pesce. Thank you for appearing before the committee. I invite you to make a brief opening 

statement. 

Mr  Pesce:    In  2008,  a  computer  science  researcher  published  a  paper  that  announced  a  fundamental 
breakthrough in computer science. It combined three pre-existing technologies and it demonstrated the technical 
feasibility  of  creating  a  strong,  secure  and  transparent  digital  currencyâ€”which  he  called  'bitcoin'.  The  idea  of 
digital currency has been with us for a generation, but bitcoin offered a solution to two of the central problems 
that had vexed other digital currencies.  

First, bitcoin relies on a distributed, decentralised network of peers to check the authenticity of the transactions 
that  are  being  made  in  the  digital  currency.  Other  digital  currencies  have  required a  central  authority,  a  central 
authority that could be attacked and subverted. Second, transactions in bitcoin are anonymous. Just as you do not 
need to reveal your identity when you are exchanging physical cash for goods and services, Bitcoin allows users 
to exchange bitcoins without revealing anything about their own identity. Other systems have tied the exchange of 
digital currency to a validated identity. The foundation for both of those new capacities lies in something that is 
called 'the block chain'. The block chain is a transparent and fully inspectable transaction record. It is, in essence, 
an open ledger book. It allows every user of bitcoins to review every bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred. 

The block chain can only be modified through consensus and it is that feature that makes bitcoin both secure 
and trustworthy. If the network of peers does not agree on the validity of a transaction, it is not added to the block 
chain and the transaction is not verified. When the network achieves consensus on the validity of a transaction, it 
is added to the block chain of all bitcoins. When you add a transaction to the block chain, essentially writing it to 
the record, it effectively authorises the transaction.  

Bitcoin transactions are not instantaneous. It takes a few minutes for the peer network to arrive at  consensus 
but the consensus when you have got it is authoritative because the entire network is vouching for transactions' 
authenticity.  It  is  also  very  secure  because  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  attack  and  subvert  the  entire  network 
supporting bitcoin. It is a strength in numbers defence. 

Those characteristics have made bitcoin the first digital currency to inspire enough trust that people will use it 
in  the  place  of  government  formal  currencies.  If  the  value  of  a  currency  is  a  reflection  of  a  user's  trust  in  that 
currency, bitcoin, which currently has an aggregate value of around $6 billion, has passed the most important test 
that the market can provide.  

Bitcoin's  block  chain  technology  has  already  found  broad  use  in  things  other  than  digital  currencies.  It  is  a 
breakthrough in authentication. So the technology has been used to create, for example, a passport that cannot be 
forged; a secure, distributed database for computers; and even a marriage contract, which has been witnessed by 
the block chain.  

So within a decade, every network device, every smartphone, every computer, everything to the internet, will 
have some version of the block chain technology inside of it. It is going to be serving as a first line of defence 
against  network  attacks.  It  will  be  providing  badly  needed  security  and  authentication  capability.  Block  chain 
technology will be everywhere. It will be in everything. It will be so pervasive, it is going to be invisible. Digital 
currencies like bitcoin are the start of a transformation that will leave our world both more open and more secure. 
Thank you.

Senate 

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

CHAIR:  There is quite a lot there. Just taking a step back, as senators we like to think we know many things, 

but certainly this is an area that is very new to many of us. Where to start? 

Senator CANAVAN:  We have been given some of your writings on this issue. What do you think the future 
potential of bitcoin is or where it is going to go? You have seemed to indicate that it may not replace currency, so 
to speak, but supplement and complement it. Could you expand on that? 

Mr  Pesce:    I  have  30  years  history  in  technology  and  the  older  I  grow  the  more  suspicious  I  become  when 
someone says,  'This is going to completely replace this thing with this other thing.' In general, what happens is 
that  the  new  thing  comes  in  and  puts  competitive  pressures  on  the  old  thing  and  they  find  an  accommodation. 
Bitcoin has advantages as a currency, particularly when you are moving in a global arena and you do not have a 
lot  of  exchange  fees  associated  with  it.  It  has  got  less  friction  associated  with  it,  although  clearly  the  banking 
infrastructure  will  need  to  adapt  to  that  around  anti-money  laundering  and  things  like  that.  Some  of  the 
advantages that bitcoin offers over other currencies are going to be tempered as bitcoin hits the real world. That is 
just the way it is with any technology. But it does offer some real advantages over other currencies. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    One  of  those  advantages  you  mentioned  is  the  transaction  cost.  I  cannot  get  a  good 
handle  on  exactly  how  more  efficient  it  is.  I  understand  banks  regularly  charge  anywhere  from  one  to  four  per 
cent  to  transfer  funds.  What  would  be  the  percentage  cost  of  bitcoin  issuanceâ€”the  full  cost  not  just  the  many 
transaction fees that might be charged but the extra coins that are then mined and put into supply? 

Mr Pesce:    There may be.  I do not know what the exact figures are. There are always some fees associated 
with any transaction in bitcoin, because you are basically paying the network to authorise the transaction. So there 
is always some level of overhead associated with it. But the overhead is generally  very low when compared to 
other kinds of bank transactions. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    Are  there  any  good  estimates  on  what  the  velocity  of  bitcoin  currency  is  at  the 

moment? I use that term in an economic sense. You said there is $6 billion roughly? 

Mr Pesce:  Six billion dollars. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I presume it is US dollars. 

Mr Pesce:  Actually, I think it is about US$5.3 billion, or around $6 billion Australian. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Five to six billion dollars in bitcoin is out there. How often is each one of those bitcoins 

used each year for a transaction, so to speak? Are there any good estimates on that? 

Mr Pesce:  It is around 50 million. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So about 10 per cent of the currency is used every day? 

Mr Pesce:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:    I have seen in some commentary that bitcoin is used more  as a store of value than a 

medium of exchange at the moment. Is that your opinion, or is that changing? 

Mr Pesce:  Bitcoin has this sort of two-headed face: is it a commodity or is it a currency? That comes down to 
the way the ATO has decided to tax it. Taxing it as a commodity rather than using it as a currency, it would be 
taxing the transactions that were performed with it. I think it does have both of those natures, just in the same way 
that someone will stuff a mattress with dollars. It has that capacity to be both a store value and a currency, so we 
are seeing people using it for both. I think while the number of avenues for using it as a currency are relatively 
limitedâ€”in other words the number of places where you can spend it are relatively limitedâ€”there is going to be 
an  impetus  for  using  it  as  a  store  value  rather  than  as  a  currency.  As  the  number  of  places  you  can  use  it  as  a 
currency grows, then it becomes more useful as a currency. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I want to come back to the taxation issue. I also noticed in the stuff you have written 
that something like 60 per cent of transactions in Kenya are by digital currency, or a form of digital currency, at 
the moment. Can you expand on why that has taken off in Kenya? 

Mr Pesce:  Kenya is the archetypal example. It is a developing nation that is relatively un-banked. Something 
like 10 or 15 per cent of Kenyans have bank accounts, yet there is a lot of money going from the cities in Kenya 
to  the  villages  in  Kenya.  This  is  because  people  go  to  the  cities,  earn  money  and  need  to  send  it  back  to  the 
villages. Before they developed the m-pesa system, which was introduced as something that was done by one of 
the mobile phone companiesâ€”a subsidiary of Vodafone did this about seven years agoâ€”a person would basically 
spend one day a week on a bus going back to the village, handing someone in their family money and then taking 
a  bus  back  to  the  city  again.  What  happened  with  the  m-pesa  was  that  as  soon  as  that  came  around  it  became 
possible to get a text code that you could SMS to a person in the village. You would deposit the money in an m-
pesa location, which would be any of the places that you could buy mobile minutes, which are all over the nation.

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

Senate 

Page 3 

You would get this code, you would text that code to the person and they would be able to go somewhere in the 
village and actually get the money. 

CHAIR:  Mr Pesce, are you saying they were effectively using mobile minutes as a currency? 

Mr Pesce:  No, the mobile minutes provider can also accept money. Mobile minutes are also used as currency 
in much of the developing world, but, in this specific case with Kenya, m-pesa is a system that sits on top of the 
mobile system that allows you to actually transfer money. That became an instant success; it is now estimated that 
between  50  and  60  per  cent  of  the  entire  GDP  of  the  Kenyan  economyâ€”seven  years  laterâ€”is  now  moving 
through m-pesa. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Earlier this year I saw you had a piece in The Drum. You said that in Australiaâ€”you 
were  comparing  it  to  Kenyaâ€”we  have  a  different  system,  we  have  PayPal,  we  have  Swift  et  cetera.  This  is 
quoting  you,  you  said,  'Adding  bitcoins  to  the  mix  does  not  provide  much  additional  capacity'.  So  you  believe 
bitcoin in Australia has a more niche role. Is that the right way to characterise it? 

Mr Pesce:  It has a lot more competition. We have a lot more payment systems; we have many more evolved 
payment  systems.  To  that  degree,  bitcoin  may  end  up  being  more  unique  because  it  does  not  have  to  fulfil  a 
fundamental role as a payment system. It will have a big role around remittances; doing international remittances 
and things like that. We are already seeing that start to develop, but I think that, because we already have a fully 
developed financial system, the kinds of applications we find for bitcoin will leverage the developed system we 
have rather than starting from scratch.  

Senator CANAVAN:  What can you buy with bitcoins now? I tried the other day and I was unsuccessfulâ€”I 

gave up after not much of an effort. How do you get bitcoins and what can you buy right now in Australia? 

Mr Pesce:  You can buy bitcoins through any number of exchanges. You have to do a cash transfer. I do not 
think the banks really like you using your credit cards for this. You have to do an electronic funds transfer to an 
exchange. You get bitcoins in return. What that formally  means is that  you have a  place to store your bitcoins, 
called a wallet. The wallet is a piece of software; it is not a physical wallet at all. That piece of software has a 
code associated with it, which is this long indecipherable string of text. If you send that to the authority that you 
are buying bitcoins from, they will then put those coins into your wallet and that transaction will then go into the 
block chain. 

Senator CANAVAN:  If you lose those numbers, it is like a piece of paperâ€” 

Mr Pesce:  You have lost the bitcoins, just like losing cash money. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So how do people secure that, given I have had computers crash beforeâ€” 

Mr Pesce:  Exactly. This is one of the things that I think people are learning: it is possible to lose bitcoinsâ€”
unlike, your bank account, for example; you cannot really lose your bank account, because your bank is keeping 
backups. People  are now  learning  that  they  need  to  keep  backups,  and  the  more  sophisticated  wallets  will  now 
have some form of storage that would be in the cloud, maybe some form of storage that is offline as well. Every 
time you do that, you are increasing a security threat to yourself, because someone could come in and take that 
copy. 

Senator CANAVAN:  They are using third party wallets effectively or banks? 

Mr  Pesce:    You  would  be storing  it  somewhere  that  is  not  immediately  under  your  control.  So  there  is  still 
some chance that that information could be copied and used. You can have a password to protect it and all the 
other things but the more you copy information the more likely it is it could end up somewhere you do not want it 
to.  

CHAIR:  It is just one long code? 

Mr Pesce:  The wallet is a hash, a long string of numbers and letters.  

CHAIR:  So I could just print that off and put it in my safe? 

Mr Pesce:  That is the addressâ€” 

CHAIR:  That is the analogue way. 

Mr Pesce:  That is the address of your wallet but the data in the walletâ€” I do not know if anyone has actually 

printed the contents of a wallet. 

Senator CANAVAN:  We might follow that up later. 

Mr Pesce:  You could certainly take the contents of your wallet, print it and put it somewhere safeâ€”it is just 

data.

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

CHAIR:  Let's take a few steps back. It all comes down to the fact that bitcoin is a currency; it is just a digital 
currency. It does not exist in a physical sense. But is it fair to say that it all comes down to trust, as you said at the 
start?  Currencies  work  when  people  have  trust  in  currencies.  If  people  do  not  have  trust  in  the  currency,  the 
currency falls over. Senator Canavan did a thesis on this. It all comes down to whether or not people do or do not 
have trust in a currency. Is that fair? 

Mr Pesce:  That is absolutely correct. 

CHAIR:  And your point is that, after having past the $6 billion mark, bitcoin is getting to the pointâ€”if not 

already at the pointâ€”where it has demonstrated to a section of the market that they can have trust in it? 

Mr Pesce:  Correct.  

CHAIR:  Walk me through this. There seems to be a disconnect, rightly or wrongly, between sections of the 
community. There are people who have faith in this currencyâ€”enough to invest $6 billion into it. And then there 
are people like us, people from a fairly conservative government perspectiveâ€”and I do not mean 'conservative' in 
the political sense; I mean that governments, major banks and reserve banks across the world are naturally very 
conservative and sceptical. So there is obviously a disconnect between how these things are viewed and treated by 
sections of the regulatory community and by sections of the market who treat them very differently. The question 
we  are  trying  to  explore  through  this  process  is:  where  is  this  disconnect?  Is  it  right?  Is  it  wrong?  Has  the 
government got it wrong, or are people putting their faith in something that understandably the regulators have 
huge concerns about? That is the process we are kind of going through.  

Mr  Pesce:    I  think  that  you  can  be  generous  with  yourself  because  this  is  very  new.  We  are  talking  about 
something that popped up as an idea only six years ago, and it really took quite a bit of time for people even to 
understand it and then to actually work with it. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Some are still taking their time. 

Mr Pesce:  These are the first hearings that the Australian Senate is having on this. It is a very new thing. It is 
probably wise to have a degree of institutional scepticism around something that is brand new like this, because if 
it is going to be a new currency it needs to be inspected from all sides and it needs to be subjected to rigorous 
tests. My sense is, talking to bankers, that they all expect that there will be a digital currency. A couple of years 
ago they were not sure which digital currency it was going to be. People are starting to think maybe it is Bitcoin, 
but  they  are  reluctant  to  work  in  it  because  there  is  not  a  lot  of  guidance  for  them  around  the  right  way  to  do 
things so that they do not break the law inadvertently or make more problems for themselves. I think that a part of 
what all of the institutional processes are engaged in is learning about this and learning how to work with it. You 
have  a  few  pioneers  out  there  who  are  doing  interesting  things.  Pioneers  are  the  ones  with  the  arrows  in  their 
backs; that is how they are identified. 

Senator EDWARDS:  A lot of pioneers died in the desertâ€” 

Mr Pesce:  Exactly. We are in this period, now: the transition between the pioneers and, probably, the settler 
phase. The settlers need things to be more regular. They need things to be a little bit more clear. The disconnect is 
not a bad thing; I think the disconnect is just the nature of this process. 

Senator  KETTER:    Could  I  just  ask  about  the  digital  wallet,  going  back  to  the  trust  issue.  You  have 

mentioned that the wallet is stored, probably in a cloud orâ€” 

Mr Pesce:  There are different ones. I have a wallet that is actually stored entirely on my smartphone. I wanted 
that because I back up my smartphoneâ€”there is a copy of itâ€”but then there is no copy in the cloud to get lost or 
stolen. So there are different approaches. 

Senator KETTER:  Can your wallet be stored in more than one place at one time? 

Mr  Pesce:    It  can  be  copied,  so  you  can  have  copies  of  that  wallet.  But,  again,  a  copy  of  the  wallet  is  the 
wallet.  A  copy  of  the  wallet  means  that,  presumably,  if  you  had  a  password  on  the  wallet  that  was  preventing 
other people from using it and someone knew the password, they could just spend your money. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Can you just explainâ€”correct me if I am wrongâ€”that, even though you can copy it, 

you can only spend it once. Whether that is through theâ€” 

Mr Pesce:  You can only spend it once, because once those transactions that spend those bitcoins end up on 
this global, inspectable transaction record, if I then go and try to spend those again, that is going to get knocked 
back because the network will say, 'I'm sorry, you have already spent those coins.' 

Senator CANAVAN:  You do not own that code anymore. 

Senator KETTER:  So, if you store it in the cloud, is it susceptible to somebody hacking into that fileâ€”

Mr Pesce:  Potentially. 

Senator KETTER:  â€”and destroying the value of that? 

CHAIR:  Or stealing the value? 

Mr Pesce:  Stealing the value. They could destroy the value if that was the only copy and they erased it. Then 

you would have lost those bitcoins. It is the same as burning a pile of money. 

Senator KETTER:  Is there an industry out there, as yet, looking at that potential? 

Mr  Pesce:    Because  there  have  been  people  who  have  lost  bitcoinsâ€”lost  themâ€”there  is  now  a  cottage 
industry of developers who are working to develop more secure solutions. You are going to see the wallet as a 
technology  evolve  along  with  the  idea  of  the  digital  currency  because,  again,  people  just  started  playing  with 
these things. I do not think there was a clear sense in the beginning that you could lose these thingsâ€”and, yes, 
you couldâ€”or that they could be stolen or copied like that. As we get further into this we are learning more about 
how to keep them safe. 

Senator KETTER:  But there would be a cottage industry looking at working out how to tap into that wallet? 

Mr Pesce:  Do you mean to steal? 

Senator KETTER:  Yes. 

Mr Pesce:  Yes. Whenever there is money, there is always going to be someone looking to get their hands on 

it. 

CHAIR:  You could argue, though, that that is a demonstration that the market has faith in its value. 

Mr Pesce:  It is worth stealing, absolutely. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    With  these  wallets  that  are  now  emerging,  effectively  they  are  banksâ€”'wallet'  is  a 
different word for 'bank', in my view. They are storing your money for you and you can get it back at some time. 
Are there actual banks emerging with Bitcoin? If I am storing your bitcoins for you, in your wallet, presumably I 
have an incentive just like a bank does to lend those bitcoinsâ€”not to transfer the physical money, so to speak, but 
to create more money backed by the fact that you have deposited those bitcoins in my bank. Do you know what I 
mean? 

Mr Pesce:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Is that happening at all or is it just 100 per cent fractionally reserved at the moment? 

Mr Pesce:  At this point, there is one bank in the world that is prepared to accept bitcoins, but I do not think it 
is doing anything that would be fractional reserve lending around bitcoin yet. Again, I think that, in the absence of 
some  regulatory  sense  around  how  that  will  work,  no-one  is  going  to  do  that.  But  they  will  happily  store  your 
bitcoin and, frankly, if you have a lot of bitcoins, storing them in a bank is probably a lovely idea. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So there are no real implications for prudential regulation at the moment, in your view, 

because this is not happening? 

Mr Pesce:  Except that it will not happen unless we have some sense around the right way to be able to do it. I 
think there is going to be a bit of a chicken and egg around that. A bitcoin bank would in fact be interested in 
doing  interesting  things  around  investment  with  bitcoin  if  they  were  being  used  in a  savings  capacity,  but  they 
would need some guidance on the right way to do that. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Perhaps we can go to those issues but maybe take a step back. From what I have read, 
the more direct issues at the moment seem to be around taxation and the definition of bitcoins. Have you looked 
at the recent ATO rulings? 

Mr Pesce:  Not in detail, but I am certainly familiar with them. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Do you have a particular view on their conclusions either from a legal perspective or 

from the perspective of the economic impact and implications for the industry in Australia? 

Mr Pesce:  My impression is that the ATO wants to frame bitcoin as if it were something close to gold bullion. 
The thing about gold bullion is that you cannot take a gold bar, peel off one millionth of it and then try to use that 
as currency, whereas you can do that with bitcoin. It has this capacity to be essentially almost infinitely divisible 
into very small parts. That is an inherent quality of it. So it really has more qualities that make it look a lot more 
like a currency than qualities that make it look a lot more like a commodity. 

That decision will then play into how Australians will be able to work with it. I do not think the preponderance 
of international decisions around this will treat bitcoin as a commodity; I think they will probably end up treating 
it more as a currency, and I suspect that that will force Australians to do things with bitcoin overseas if they want 

 

ECONOMICS REFERENCES COMMITTEE 

Page 6 

Senate 

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

to  be  using  it  in  a  currency  perspective.  So  the  decision  the  ATO  makes  will  have  a  profound  impact  on  how 
Australian  businesses,  Australian  banks  and  Australian  individuals  will  be  able  to  work  with  bitcoins  going 
forward. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Do you have enough day-to-day experience with the industry to explain to us exactly 
what the practical implications are of defining it as gold bullion, so to speak, or a commodity and not a currency? 
How does it affect people running a bitcoin business? 

Mr Pesce:  If you are trying to do transactions that are crossing currencies, it becomes a lot more difficult if 
you are dealing with a currency that is not being treated as a currency versus a currency that is being treated as a 
currency. I do not know if you can quite call it double taxation, but there is an impact there because every time 
you  move  out  of  the  currency  you  are  getting  a  GST  attached  to  it  which  is  beyond  just  the  transaction.  That 
effectively puts some friction onâ€” 

Senator CANAVAN:  Would you repeat that? If I were to exchange bitcoins for Australian dollars, potentially 
I  would  have  a  GST  liability,  provided  the  businesses  involved  are  over  the  thresholds  for  GST.  Every  time  I 
convertâ€”putting aside the gold issue, which is seen as a currency a bit moreâ€”it is just like buying a tonne of coal 
or something like that. I have to pay GST on that; it is a transaction. 

Mr Pesce:  Yes. That would then end up slowing the flow of transactions because you get this extra friction on 

all of the transactions. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    But  the  GST  is  a  value-added  tax,  so  does  how  the  ATO  determine  the  value  added 

there? You are right: it should not have a tax on transactions; it should be a tax on the value added. 

Mr Pesce:  That is the aggregate difference in theâ€”I am just trying toâ€” 

Senator CANAVAN:  That is okay. We probably need to speak to the ATO at some point in this inquiry, so 
we can explore those issues more then. What about the capital gains tax issues? Are they ones you are concerned 
about? 

Mr Pesce:  There is a capital gains issue insofar as the price of bitcoins is highly variable. You will have Kevin 
Zhou  on the panel later on today, but, when I was talking to him at the global currency summit that we had in 
Brisbane during the G20, he pointed out that there is an actual correlation between the price of a bitcoin and the 
amount  of  electricity  that  it  takes  to  mine  a  bitcoin.  Just  a  step  back here:  bitcoins  are  mined,  as  I  put  that,  by 
solving  a  very  complex  problem  with  a  computerâ€”so  complex  that  it  actually  costs  almost  $300  in  electricity 
costs  to  mine  a  single  bitcoin.  So  it  is  very  much  like  your  goldminer.  You  have  to  make  sure  that  the  cost  of 
mining the gold is a little bit less than the cost that the gold is on the market. Now, because of the way mining 
works  and  because  mining  is  increasingly  becoming  more  difficultâ€”that  is  another  one  of  the  mathematical 
qualities  of  Bitcoinâ€”the  cost  of  a  bitcoin,  to  create  a  bitcoin,  is  now  becoming  more  stable.  So  the  price  of  a 
bitcoin,  theoretically,  will  stabilise  somewhere  around  its  cost  to  mineâ€”and  also  then  related  to  its  supply  and 
demand. So the volatility around that, which would affect capital gains, should be decreasing over time. That is a 
supposition based on available evidence. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    Just  on  that,  I  am  interested  in  that  $300  per  bitcoin.  That  is  pretty  close  to  what 

bitcoins are trading atâ€” 

Mr Pesce:  That is what I am saying, exactly. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Is that basically a fall in the price? If it goes belowâ€”sorry, a ceiling, if you like. 

Mr Pesce:  No, it is a floor, because if it goes below that it is no longer economic to mine bitcoins and then the 

minersâ€” 

Senator CANAVAN:  So it constrains the supply and increases the price. 

Mr Pesce:  Exactly. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    If  it  goes  over  that  much  too  much,  is  there  an  incentive  to  mine  and  increase  the 

supply? 

Mr Pesce:  Then you get more and more people mining because it becomes more economic to do so. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So what is going to happen when mining finishes? 

Mr Pesce:  That is in the year 2140, or something like that. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I thought I read 2040. So it is too far away to worry about. 

Mr Pesce:  At this point. We may be having these hearings in another hundred years asking that question.

Senator CANAVAN:  Okay. You have described lots of different areas of the industry: banks or potential for 
banks, wallets, mines, exchanges. What elements of that industry could potentially thrive here in Australia? Do 
you have a view on that? What elements of the bitcoin industry could thrive in Australia? 

Mr Pesce:  We have an extremely sophisticated financial services sector. So there are a lot of financial services 
that  can  be  built  not  just  with  Bitcoin  but  using  the  block  chain.  I  think  we  are  going  to  see  new  forms  of 
mutualised insurance and new forms of savings banksâ€”entirely  very different and more distributed forms with 
less centralised but  more distributed forms of all of these things that are going  to start to arise out of the basic 
technology that underlies Bitcoin. I also think that we are going to have a very strong role in remittances into the 
Pacificâ€”which we already do, but I think that more of that is going to move into currencies that will have a lower 
cost associated with them for people using them. I think there are a couple of different areas that are, right off the 
bat, going to be quite interesting and quite successful. But I think in the longer term we have a real capacity to 
reshape the way financial services will work. I think that over the next generation that is what we will start to see. 

Senator CANAVAN:  We have spoken about the tax issues. Are there any other regulatory or legal issues and 

barriers that you see to such an industry emerging in Australia? 

Mr Pesce:   One of the most interesting conversations that I had at the global dialogue was with Jerry Brito, 
who works with regulators in the United States. He essentially said that most of the regulators in the United States 
are waiting for something they called the BitLicense, which are going to be promulgated by the New York state 
banking regulator sometime in the near futureâ€”sometime in the next six months. Now, if they do it well it will 
become a prototype for other regulatory domains. If they do it poorly, it will become a prototype of what not to do 
in  other  regulatory  domains.  I  think  what  that  starts  to  become  is  a  conversation  that  is  an  international 
conversation  between  regulators  in  financial  institutions  around  the  right  way  to  be  able  to  incorporate  digital 
currencies into an economy. I think that that is probably the most important thing. We need to stay involved in 
that conversation and, where we can, we need to be leading that conversation. I think the most important thing is 
to stay involved in that conversation because the conversation is going to have impacts throughout the rest of this 
century. 

Senator EDWARDS:  Who makes money out of bitcoin? 

Mr Pesce:  The exchanges make money out of bitcoin, the miners make money out of bitcoin. All of that is the 
case. If you are an exchange you are taking a transaction fee when you are moving money in and out of bitcoin to 
another  currency.  If  you  are  a  miner  you  are  actually  creating  new  bitcoins  which  everyone  wants  and  you  are 
making money off of that. 

Senator EDWARDS:  Can I be a miner? 

Mr Pesce:  Yes, you can. 

Senator EDWARDS:  Okay, tell me how I become a miner. 

Mr Pesce:  A bitcoin mine is a piece of software, and you would run it on your computer, and your computer 
would get very hot, and you would get all of these big electric bills, and you would go, 'Why are my electric bills 
so high?' It is becauseâ€” 

Senator EDWARDS:  Are you being serious? 

Mr Pesce:  Absolutely serious. 

Senator EDWARDS:  Really? 

Mr Pesce:  I am absolutely serious. In the early days there were a lot of folks who were running them at home 
making bitcoins. These days it is in fact generally large banks of computers, which are squirrelled away under a 
lot  of  air  conditioning,  using  the  latest  generation  chips,  still  using  a  lot  of  power  to  solve  these  mathematical 
functions. Part of the mathematical function that is being solved by these miners is checking the ledger. Part of 
what they are doing to earn these bitcoins is to make sure that all of these transactions, which are publicly stored, 
are all adding up and are all in agreement. 

CHAIR:    I  think  we  are  dealing  with  people  who  understand  regulation,  understand  government  and 
understand things like the ATO and processes, and there is the other world, which is the digital world, in which, I 
think it is fair to say, our  understanding is more limited. So  take a step back. Tell me if this is right, because I 
want to get my understanding of this right. I am trying to make this as simple as possible for myself. Bitcoin gets 
around the need for third party intermediaries by distributing a ledger of transactions among everyone within the 
system.  Effectively,  when  we  talk  about  the  block  chain  in  language  that  we  understand,  it  is  simply  just  a 
distributed ledger. 

Mr Pesce:  It is a publicly inspectable distributed ledger.

CHAIR:  And that is the block chain. 

Mr Pesce:  That is the block chain. 

CHAIR:    Every  new  transaction  is  checked  against  the  block  chain  to  verify  that  bitcoins  have  not  already 

been spent, so you cannot have double spending. 

Mr Pesce:  Correct. 

CHAIR:    So, bitcoin relies  on users providing the computer processing power needed to maintain the block 

chain. Maintaining the block chain is, effectively, part of what you are doing when you are mining a bitcoin. 

Mr Pesce:  Correct. 

CHAIR:  That is how it is, kind of, a self-sustaining standing system. 

Mr Pesce:  Correct, you got it. 

CHAIR:  I think I got it. My incentive to participate in the process and to maintain this entire system is, 'This 

is how I create bitcoins for myself.' 

Mr Pesce:  Correct. 

CHAIR:  I think I broadly get that. This is not the area we are focused on, which is the digital side, but to get 

an understanding of the other side. What is a bitcoin worth right now? 

Mr Pesce:  About A$440. 

CHAIR:  About A$440. How volatile has that been? 

Mr Pesce:  Over what period of time? 

CHAIR:  Fair enough. Eight or 10 years ago it was worth nothing. 

Mr Pesce:  To give you an example, there was a spike in bitcoin prices to $1,600 about 18 months ago, which 
correlated  precisely  with  when  the  banks  in  Cyprus  decided  they  were  going  to  take  a  cut  out  of  everyone's 
banking accounts. So, a lot of the dollars in Cyprus, a lot of the money stored in Cyprus, went into bitcoin until it 
could find its way into other currencies. There have been spikes and troughs. That was probably the first time that 
bitcoin had been seen by people who were in a hurry and thought, 'Wait, I need that as a store value,' and money 
flowed into it and money flow back out again. 

CHAIR:    That  is  traditionally  what  the  US  dollar  has  done  in  those  kinds  of  circumstances.  That  is 

traditionally the stable place. 

[inaudible] 

Senator EDWARDS:  It is only US45.2 billion, so, if there is a rush on it, where do more bitcoins come from? 

Mr Pesce:  Bitcoins are being generated at a range of relatively stable rate of around 25 every 10 minutes, so it 
is not as though you cannot grow the money supply arbitrarily to meet demand. What would happen is the price 
would go up, which is precisely what happened. 

Senator EDWARDS:  What is stopping it from going to 1,000 every 10 minutes? 

Mr Pesce:  Right now, probably the supply and demand sides are relatively stably managed. 

Senator EDWARDS:  What if I have a big computer and a big power cord at my place and I keep doubling up 

and keep going mining? 

Mr Pesce:  One of the qualities of mining is that it becomes progressively more difficult through time. Every 
bitcoin is harder. It is like a mine where you are running out of the vein, and the vein is getting narrower as you 
go further and further into the mine. 

Senator EDWARDS:  What if I turn around and go to the other side of the mine? 

Mr Pesce:  There is not a vein on the other side of the mine. There is only this vein, and you are mining it out 

with that vein is, over time going to run out. 

Senator  EDWARDS:    A  lot  of  my  teachers  suspected  I  was  dyslexic.  So,  I  cannot  continually  mine  the 

bitcoin? 

Mr  Pesce:    You  can  continually  mine  for  bitcoin,  but  you  have  to  continually  throw  more  power  at  the 

problem to get the same amount of bitcoins out. 

Senator  EDWARDS:    I  could  be  somebody  new.  I  could  be  Senator  Canavan,  and  start  up  and  find  a  new 

vein, and it gets progressively harder for him.

Mr Pesce:  When he starts mining he is starting out mining at exactly the same coalface you are mining, so he 
is mining the same vein. He does not have a different vein. You are all mining the same vein. As that vein gets 
narrower it is getting harder for all of you. It is much, much harder to mine for bitcoins today than it was in 2008. 

CHAIR:  That is the same as saying that I can go home today and start mining minerals, putting aside the New 
South Wales planning laws. There is so much to talk about, Mr Pesce, and we have a roundtable discussion a bit 
later today. I am very conscious of time and how many people we want to get through. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I just want to follow up on the mining issue. As a result of a transaction occurring the 
mining opportunity occurs because of the transaction occurring. Is that right? Someone wants to transfer bitcoins 
from  one  person  to  another  and  therefore  the  mining  activity  needs  to  occur  to  verify  that  transaction,  is  that 
correct? 

Mr Pesce:  Absolutely. Mining also produces new bitcoins, so it is doing two things at once. It is checking the 

transaction and create bitcoins. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    Can  people  opportunistically  do  those  transactions  just  to  mine  the  bitcoins?  If  Sean 
and I were in a mining operation, could I transfer bitcoins from me to Sean just for the sake of it, as we are both in 
partnership, just to be able to mine and create new bitcoins? Can people do that or are they waiting for someone to 
actually buy goods or service before they actually mine? 

Mr Pesce:  Probably both. You can just transfer bitcoins, and, yes, there is a transaction cost associated with it. 

Senator CANAVAN:  That is where you get instability around the price because if the prize goes too high that 

sort of activity suddenly becomes profitable. 

Mr Pesce:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Okay.

SOMMER, Mr Andrew, Partner, Clayton Utz 

[09:18] 

CHAIR:  I now welcome Mr Andrew Sommer from Clayton Utz. Before we go to questions, do you want to 
make an opening statement? There will be a panel discussion later that will cover a lot of things, so if you want to 
also outline in your opening statement the areas in which you feel you are best qualified to answer questions in. 
We are dealing with regulation, law, taxation and the digital space, and we do not want to be directing the wrong 
set of questions to you. 

Mr Sommer:  My area is taxation particularly the indirect taxation consequences of these transactions, so I am 
happy  to  pick  up  on  some  of  Senator  Canavan's  points  a  bit  later.  The  interaction  between  bitcoin  and  the 
domestic tax system has been one of the issues that has been fraught in pretty  much every jurisdiction that has 
tried to adopt bitcoin. I speak primarily about bitcoin, and I know that the scope of the inquiry is digital currency. 
For  reasons  that  Mark  was  saying  earlier,  the  dominance  of  bitcoin  is  such  that  the  focus  is  on  that,  but  the 
comments can equally be extended to other forms of digital currency. 

One  of  the  reasons  why  this  has  been  so  critical  is  that  the  adoption  rate  of  bitcoin  can  be  slowed  by  the 
domestic tax treatment, particularly in the GST/VAT space. Where GST or VAT is imposed on the acquisition of 
bitcoins as part of a trading transaction, it makes it much more difficult and much less economically viable for me 
to take my Australian dollars and convert them into bitcoin if one-eleventh of that transaction is going to be lost in 
GST  at  the  point  that  I  do  that.  For  everyday  consumers,  that  one-eleventh  cost  is  a  real  cost.  That  is  a 
consequence of treating bitcoin like a commodity rather than a currency. 

We  have  special  rules  in  the  GST  framework  to  deal  with  gold  bars  and  investment-grade  precious  metals. 
They are treated as input tax supplies under our GST system. They are treated as GST-free in their first iteration 
and then on subsequent supplies, they are treated as input tax, so they do not form part of the tax base. That is 
because, from a GST/VAT design perspective, all over the world money is excluded from the tax base for some 
of  the  reasons  stated  earlier.  It  is  a  consumption  tax  at  its  heart.  It  is  designed  to  tax  private  consumption 
expenditure. When you are converting your Australian dollars into a means of exchange or a store of value, that 
does not form part of the consumption base. Therefore, from a design perspective, if you were going to design a 
GST today, you would design it to exclude digital currencies. There is no good tax design reason why you would 
design it to include digital currencies within the tax base. Bitcoin is functionally money and, for that reason, you 
would design the system to operate in that.  

Part  of  the  concern  that  I  have  is  that  the  current  proposed  treatment  by  the  tax  office  in  the  draft  rulings, 
particularly  in  relation  to  GST  and  FBT,  provides  the  most  problematic  outcome  from  a  GST  perspective.  It 
would be preferable for bitcoin to be treated like a foreign currency, so that when I take my AUD and convert it to 
USD,  I  pay  a  fee  for  that  transaction  and  that  fee  is  for  a  service  and  I  have  consumed  that  service.  That  is 
properly part of the tax base, but merely shifting the value from AUD to USD does not consume anything and 
consequently, from an ideal perspective, you would want that taken out.  

My  other  concern  is  one  of  the  consequences  of  the  tax  office's  current  proposed  treatment.  They  are 
constrained  by  the  law  and  one  of  the  advantages  of  ventilating  this  in  this  forum  is  we  can  talk  about  the 
legislative reform that is necessary. But the difficulty within taxation of these transactions is it does give rise to 
the potential for trader fraud. In Europe one of the great difficulties is missing trader fraud. So somebody makes a 
taxable supply, in our vernacular, and disappears from the supply chain, the commissioner has to pay out the input 
tax credit and has difficulty recovering the tax from the entity making the taxable supply. By imposing GST on all 
of  these  transactions  of  converting  dollars  to  bitcoin  and  bitcoin  to  dollars  and  so  on,  we  increase  the 
opportunities for that sort of activity to occur, whereas by excluding it from the tax base, it is a whole layer of 
taxable and creditable transactions that we take out, and we avoid that difficulty. 

From a treatment perspective, bitcoin does not need a whole raft of special rules; it  just needs to be brought 
within the right mechanics under the income tax law, the FBT  law and the GST  law that would enable it to be 
treated really for what it isâ€”a means of exchange and a store of value. Let's tax it like that. If we cannot get there 
under the terms of the current law, we need to look at changes to those laws to achieve that end. 

CHAIR:  At the moment, in a practical sense, there is a coffee vendor down the road in Canberra, a little cafe, 
which  will  accept  bitcoin.  Right  now,  if  I  want  to  buy  my  breakfast  using  bitcoin,  I  would  have  to  get  my 
Australian dollars and convert them to bitcoin. In doing so, I would be paying somebody a transaction fee of a 
few cents, the same as if I was changing it to US dollars to buy something at an airportâ€” 

Senator EDWARDS:  Is it a few cents? 

 

ECONOMICS REFERENCES COMMITTEE

Senate 

Page 11 

CHAIR:  I think it depends on the size of how many dollars you are changing. Are the rates that you would be 

charged for changing Australian dollars to bitcoin comparable to changing Australian dollars to US dollars? 

Mr Sommer:  Depending on where you are doing it, it is a matter of two or three per cent. 

CHAIR:  I imagine if it is much larger, it becomes less and you would negotiate these things like you do for 

any kind of foreign exchange or any kind of transaction. 

Mr Sommer:  Sure. 

Senator EDWARDS:  Is that right? The more you exchange, the less it is? 

Mr Sommer:  I do not have the rates in front of me. My experience is buying a bitcoin for the purposes of my 
own  interest.  You  pay  a  fee  of  roughly  2Â½  per  cent  as  a  consumer;  the  rates  beyond  that  I  think  are  simply  a 
matter of negotiation. 

CHAIR:  I think we have some people later on who are in a better place to answer that. This is where it gets a 
bit oddâ€”I am being charged the GST on that transaction and I am being charged the GST on the breakfast that I 
am buying. 

Mr Sommer:  Correct. 

CHAIR:  And that is the disparity. 

Mr Sommer:  Correct. 

CHAIR:  Obviously, I spoke to the ATO about this at the start of this processâ€”I want to get this on the record, 
it  is  more  of  a  statement  than  a  question,  but  I  think  it  is  fair  to  put  their  defence  on  the  recordâ€”and  their 
argument  is  the  Australian  tax  framework  was  created  20  to  25  years  ago  and  then there  was  an  update  period 
with the GST, which is over a decade ago. The argument goes that, when the tax system was being created, none 
of this was envisaged because it did not exist. The comparison the ATO gave me was that they treat bitcoin the 
same  way  they  treat  basketball  cards  or  postersâ€”a  commodity  that  is  tradeable  as  opposed  to  a  currency.  The 
defence from the ATO was that people are making the point that this is an issue of regulationâ€”it is not an issue of 
regulation; it is an issue of policyâ€”and that we, as the regulator in terms of the tax system, will follow the law as 
the law currently exists. I want to get your opinion on this as you are a legal expert: whether we want to treat it 
differently or not is not the question; we are incapable of doing so because the framework does not allow us to 
treat it differentlyâ€”that is the ATO's position. You are the lawyer, you tell me is that aâ€” 

Mr Sommer:  One of the great things about tax law is that you can always argue both sides. In relation to this 
particular issue, there are two or three key definitions: there is money, currency and foreign currency. In relation 
to the GST law, the key definition for most of this will be the definition of money. That definition is an 'includes' 
definition. There is an argument to be made that the definition of money as it sits in section 1951 of the GST Act 
is  capable,  on  its  current  terms,  of  extending  to  bitcoin.  I  have  made  that  argument  and  others  have  made  that 
argument in submission to the commissioner. The commissioner has formed the view that that is not the scope of 
the current definition.  

Other definitions or phrases used in the GST regulations for currency of another country become even  more 
problematic. Can you actually say that as of today's date bitcoin is the currency of another countryâ€”you would 
have to say  that that is a difficult definition to make out. There is a raft of issues that needs to be addressed in 
there. 

CHAIR:  Take a step back then. You are making the point that you have a different legal interpretation than 
the ATO has, and you have made that case. I think the point that they are trying to makeâ€”and I would like to get 
this on the record, and we will give them an opportunity to come and respond, but they have been very clear to 
meâ€”is that they are not passing judgement on how it should or should not be treated by taxation; they are passing 
judgement on how they feel the restrictions within the act mean they are forced to interpret something. 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. That is my understanding. The tax office are constrained by the law as it is written. They 
are mere administrators of the law; they are not an instrument of policy. And so they say: 'We've looked at this 
definition of money. To us, bitcoin is outside the definition of money.' It is not unusual, as you would know, for 
different people to form a different view in relation to a matter of interpretation of an existing definition. 

CHAIR:    How  does  our  taxation  treatment  of  bitcoin  compare  to  that  of  other  like-minded  Western  OECD 

nations? 

Mr Sommer:  Initially Her Majesty's Customs and Excise in the UK tried to treat it as a commodity, which is 
the current proposed treatment by our revenue authorities. They walked away from that in March this year, and 
they formed the view that, under the framework of their law, bitcoin is treated like private money, so it is treated 

 

ECONOMICS REFERENCES COMMITTEE 

Page 12

like money. It is what we would call in our system an input-taxed supply, much like investment gold bars, and not 
taxed, because under theâ€” 

CHAIR:  Did they do that through legislation or through regulation? 

Mr Sommer:  They did that through interpreting their law as it was, based on theâ€” 

CHAIR:  But there was not a billâ€”that you are aware ofâ€”that got passed through the UK parliament? 

Mr Sommer:  The revenue authorities changed their view in relation to the taxationâ€” 

CHAIR:  And did a tax ruling? 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  You touched on this just a bit earlier, but is it your view that, for the specific definition 
of money that we are talking about here, we need to change the laws of our country, or can we just get a different 
interpretation from the Commissioner of Taxation to deal with the issues that you have raised? 

Mr Sommer:  I think the definition of money can be interpreted to include bitcoin. That gets us some way but 
not the whole way. I think the best solution across the board is to introduce a new concept of 'digital currency' and 
include that within the concepts of currency. That would then flow through into the definition of money, and you 
would solve the problem that way. But we could include a new concept of 'digital currency' to that end. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    Can  I  just  go  back  a  bit  and  make  sure  about  something?  The  ATO  have  issued  a 
guidance document for people, off their website, and then there is a broader draft taxation determination that they 
issued on 20 August. 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. There are four different draft rulings that the commissioner has issuedâ€”one on GST, one 

on FBT, one on capital gains tax and one on trading stock. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    Right.  I  have  probably  only  read  the  one  here.  This  relates  to  the  Income  Tax 

Assessment Act. Would that include GST? 

Mr Sommer:  No. 

Senator CANAVAN:  That is under the new tax system, isn't it? I was just a bit surprised reading it. They did 
quote  extensively  from  case  law.  To  me,  the  case  law  seems  to  indicateâ€”this  is  from  a  decision  by  Justice 
Emmett: 

â€¦ a thing can be money and can operate as a generally accepted medium and means of exchange, without being legal tender. 

I am just not sure why they could not conclude that bitcoin would be money. I suppose I am just confirming your 
point. 

Mr  Sommer:    That  particular  decision  of  Justice  Emmett,  in  the  case  called  Travelex,  concerned  the 
conversion of AUD into Fijian dollars, and Justice Emmett was called to consider the scope of the definition of 
money. The case went all the way up to the High Court, and the High Court had no qualms with the interpretation 
that Justice Emmett adopted at first instance. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What was the exchange there? I missed that. 

Mr Sommer:  AUD to Fiji dollars. Justice Emmett laid down, I think, a fairly broad test for money. He makes 
the  point  that  over  time  there  have  been  banknotes  issued  by  banksâ€”non-government  backed  currenciesâ€”and 
they were adopted as currency and treated and taxed as currency. He seems to be adopting a breadth of definition 
of money that would support the inclusion of bitcoin. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    The  Australian  Commissioner  of  Taxation  was  defending  that  caseâ€”is  that  right?  It 

was their view at the time that Fijian dollars were not money. 

Mr Sommer:  The case actually turned on the question of whether or not it was a GST-free supply. It turned 

on matters not immediately relevant. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I note that, when the commissioner came to his conclusion, he says that 'the current use 
and acceptance of Bitcoin in the community is not sufficiently widespread such that' it satisfies a particular test. 
Do you believe that a currency has to be in widespread use to meet the legal definition of money? 

Mr Sommer:  Yes, I think there needs to be a breadth of acceptance. It cannot just be a minor thing. It has to 
have a significant and community acceptance and trust, as Mark was saying earlier. In relation to that, one of the 
things the commissioner does not do in that draft ruling is to identify the point at which that breadth of acceptance 
will occur. Assuming we are not there yet, there is the potential for that point to be reached in the future. At that 
point,  we  will  have  this  switch  from  the  current  proposed  treatmentâ€”where  it  is  taxed  as  a  commodityâ€”to  it 
being  taxed  as  a  currency.  That  will  lead  to  all  sorts  of  transitional  complexitiesâ€”they  will  arise  at  that  point

where acceptance reaches critical mass for the purposes of it being accepted by the commissioner as money. The 
other alternative is that, as soon as a single country, no matter what size, adopts bitcoin as their national currency, 
it  so  becomes  a  foreign  currency  and  therefore  becomes  a  currency  and  therefore  becomes  money.  We  are 
actually, then, at the mercy of some other jurisdiction deciding that they will adopt bitcoin as their currency. That 
has a direct and immediate effect throughout our income tax, our goods and services tax and our FBT law. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I want to come back to you on a couple of things you mentioned there. On that point 
about  foreign  currency:  you  mentioned  earlier  there  is  a  definition  of  money,  a  definition  of  currency  and  a 
definition of foreign currency. The definition of money is the pertinent one for GST? 

Mr Sommer:  For most of it, yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  The other twoâ€”are they pertinent for income tax assessment? 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Presumably the definition of foreign currency is narrower than the definition of money. 

Is that your interpretation? 

Mr  Sommer:    Yes,  the  definition  of  foreign  currency  is,  effectively,  the  currency  of  a  country  other  than 

Australia. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    In  that  case,  in  the  income  tax  assessment  issue,  to  expand  it  to  cover  digital 
currenciesâ€”we  would  need  a  change  to  the  law.  It  would  be  too  hard  to  interpret  bitcoinâ€”apart  from  another 
nation's government actually adopting itâ€”as a foreign currency. 

Mr  Sommer:    Oddly,  the  use  of  concepts  of  money  and  currency  within  the  income  tax  law  are  relatively 
narrow,  so  it  would  have  some  potential  implications  for  the  operation  of  division  960  and  the  taxation  of 
financial  arrangements  provisions.  But  it  should  not  have  a  material  impact  on  whether  or  not  mining  activity 
results in assessable income. It does, it should and it will. It is more for its flow-on effect into the GST law and 
the FBT law. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Just to repeat that back to you: in your view it is the ruling on GST that has a bigger 
impact on the Australian bitcoin industry than the ruling on CGT and other aspects of the Income Tax Assessment 
Act. 

Mr Sommer:  Exactly. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What are the capital gains tax implications of the ruling? 

Mr Sommer:  In the CGT ruling, the commissioner forms the view that bitcoin is property and that bitcoin is 
capable of being an asset for CGT purposesâ€”that disposal can trigger a capital gain, that it is an A1 event and so 
on. 

Senator CANAVAN:  If I buy a coffee, is that a CGT event if bitcoin has gone up while I have been holding 

it? 

Mr Sommer:  If you trade your bitcoin for coffee and the value of the coffee exceeds the value of your cost 

base in the bitcoin, then, yes, you can have a CGT event. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Is there a threshold for that? Or do I even have to pay CGT for just two bucks? 

Mr Sommer:  I do not know; I am sorry. My CGT expertise is limited. 

CHAIR:  Can we get Mr Pesce back to talk about things I understand! On legal challenges, we have kind of 
discussed  the  legal  tax  framework  issue. And, again,  the  ATO  will  speak  for  itself,  but  from  what  you  and  the 
ATO have both saidâ€”you on the record, and the ATO will have that opportunityâ€”is that effectively at this point 
in time the issue has been ventilated and the decision of the ATO, which is quite public, is that they are going to 
deal with it as a commodity. You are of the view that that is a major impediment to the practical use of bitcoin. 
And I think others will have the opportunity today to talk about what impact that has on the growth of the industry 
in  Australia.  So,  park  that  for  a  moment.  What  other  legal  challenges  do  you  think  the  committee  needs  to  be 
looking  at  as  we  go  ahead  with  our  investigation,  our  exploration,  our  committee  inquiry?  What  other  legal 
challenges are being faced aside from simply the taxation law? 

Mr Sommer:  My expertise is in the taxation aspects of it, but the other legal and regulatory aspects and how it 
fits  into  current  frameworks  under  governmental  supervision  are  simplified  where  we  have  a  conceptual 
framework for dealing with this thing and we say that it is money-like in its behaviour and let's regulate it as that 
for tax purposes and for other purposes. 

CHAIR:  I want to touch on that. Your point is that there is already a framework for how we deal with money. 

Mr Sommer:  Yes.

CHAIR:  Now, the question is: is bitcoin so unique that it cannot fit into the existing framework as money? 
Or, is it similar enough that if we simply treated it as money, in the same way that we treat some currencies that 
are  smaller  and  larger,  then the  framework  is  already  big  enough and  strong  enough  and  we  do  not  need  to  do 
anything unique in that regulatory space except simply treat it as money? 

Mr Sommer:  My understanding is that that is correctâ€”that the existing regulatory framework is sufficiently 
strong that, if you bring it within the operation as money, that would produce an outcome that is consistent with 
where the industry wants to go and the adoption of it and that achieves the government-oversight purposes. 

CHAIR:  I will ask you to take this on notice; if you want to add more to it I will give you the opportunity to, 
because we are going through a process. I know there are other complications here, but you are making it pretty 
simple. You are saying that if we simply say that we have this existing framework, and so much has gone into this 
framework  about  how  we  tread  with  money  and  debates  and  this  and  that,  then,  'Bring  this  into  that  space  and 
treat it as money', and everything on the regulatory front will flow. 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. We do have a highly advanced regulatory framework that it can be incorporated into. 

CHAIR:  In this digital space and in this kind of area I think it is fair to say that there is a fairly libertarian 

streak that runs through some of this kind of space on the internetâ€” 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. 

CHAIR:  some of it well-intentioned and some of it less well-intentioned. There are those who argue that there 
should  be  no  role  for  government,  there  should  be  no  role  for  regulation  and,  frankly,  the  entire  conversation 
around taxation should be ignored because all this should exist outside the taxation space. There are some of us 
who  think  that  that  is  not  only  stupid  but  unrealisticâ€”that  if  you  are  not  involved  in  shaping  regulation  then 
regulation shapes you, that government does not go away simply because you do not want to deal with it. But I 
would not mind getting your legal view on all that. 

Mr Sommer:  Again, from my perspective as a taxation lawyer I have clients who transact in bitcoin. We need 
to deal with the tax office in relation to those transactions. We need to demonstrate the proof elements of the fact 
that we have incurred the expense, that we have derived the income. All of those things need to operate within the 
existing  framework  and  the  existing  rules  of  evidence  and  procedures  of  dealing  with  the  tax  office  and  other 
regulators. At that point those things are unavoidable. The commissioner has his powers of default assessment. He 
can investigate it if there is an accretion to wealth that is unexplainedâ€”because people have been transacting in 
bitcoin in a way that they have achieved a degree of anonymity, much like transacting in cash. The commissioner 
has  existing  powers  to  investigate  and  make  his  determinations,  and  the  taxpayer  has  the  obligation  to 
demonstrate their side of the story. 

CHAIR:  To touch on that, regarding the whole other set of issuesâ€”which we are going to get some people to 
speak  to as  we  go  along,  with  AUSTRAC  and  othersâ€”of  whether  this  is  being  misused  or can be  misused  for 
nefarious activities: you are saying that you actually address a lot of those problems by placing it within the tax 
system, because you create a different kind of transparency mechanism. Can you explain that? 

Mr Sommer:  By bringing it into the regulator transactions by legitimising it and by giving it scope to operate 
on  a  day-to-day  business  basis,  there  are,  under  the  existing  rules,  mechanisms  for  demonstrating  how 
transactions occurred. The block chain provides a slightly different tool for making those demonstrations. There 
are different ways in which you would do that for bitcoin-related transactions. But the fundamental principles are 
unchanged. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Perhaps I could just go back to when you said that there should be a minimum level of 
acceptance, or that you accept the view of the Commissioner of Taxation that a digital currency should have some 
element of widespread use  before it is adopted as  money.  I  want to  tease out the economic or  market structure 
implications of that. We have spoken a lot about bitcoin, but there are alternative digital currencies. 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I am just wondering: if we adopted a legal or regulatory perspective that you must meet 
a minimum level of use before you get to be in this club, wouldn't that be a bit of a barrier to market entry and 
stop competition among alternative currencies? 

Mr  Sommer:    Yes.  I  think  that  is  exactly  right.  And  one  of  the  policy  decisions  that  needs  to  be  made  in 
relation to bringing digital currencies within the existing currency and money framework is: do we do it for all 
digital currencies, irrespective of their level of market adoption, or do we include some sort of hurdle that they 
need  to  pass  in  order  to  get  in?  That  is  a  policy  decision,  and  I  suppose  in  one  sense,  from  a  tax  design 
perspective, it does not matter. If something is a particularly small-niche digital currency, provided that it is what 

 

ECONOMICS REFERENCES COMMITTEE 

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

Senate 

Page 15 

we call an open system in the sense that it is available to everybodyâ€”you do not have to be a member of a club or 
sign up to particular terms and conditionsâ€”then does it really matter that we bring it into the currency framework 
early from a tax design perspective? My personal view is that I do not think it would make a difference. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    Does  that  go  to  something  that  I  think  you  said  earlierâ€”that  your  first  best  option 

would be to insert a digital currency definition in our tax laws? 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Presumably that definition would require a digital currency to meet certain tests, which 

may or may not include its use or its market share, so to speak. 

Mr  Sommer:    Yes.  You  would  want  to  distinguish  it  from  other  closed  systems,  like  Bartercard  and  other 

systems of exchange. 

Senator CANAVAN:  World of Warcraft and things like that! I have never played that game, I must say! 

Mr Sommer:  Virtual virtual currencies is a whole different thing! 

Senator CANAVAN:  So, it would be more a character test, in a senseâ€”the character of these currencies, not 

their potential adoption or use. 

Mr Sommer:  From a design perspective, any time you include that hurdle you have a problem of transition. 
And that problem of transition of moving from commodity treatment to currency treatment is going to give rise to 
tax leakage, it is going to give rise to compliance issues, and it is best to avoid it if we can. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Are there any definitions at the moment floating around, in  other jurisdictions? Is there 

a definition of digital currency in their laws as such? 

Mr Sommer:  Not that I am aware of, no. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Finally, you mentioned earlier that you have clients, or bitcoin clients, that use bitcoins. 
Since August, then, have you noticed any direct impact on their businesses from the taxation ruling? And have 
people packed up and left or are they thinking about leaving et cetera? 

Mr  Sommer:    The  great  difficulty  for  those  people  who  make  bitcoin  available  to  consumers  is:  they  are 
competing with offshore providers who do not have this impost. Even under the design of our GST, if I go on to a 
US bitcoin trader's website and buy bitcoin from them, even on the ATO's view there is no taxable transaction. 
Our reverse charge rules do not kick in. There is no tax to be paid. However, if I go on to an Australian trader's 
website, I will incur a one-eleventh charge for GST. It will be leakage. Why would I go to the Australian website 
when  I  can  get  exactly  the  same  thing  straight  into  my  wallet  on  my  phone  through  the US  website  versus  the 
Australian website? 

Senator CANAVAN:  Thank you, Mr Sommer; that is very good. There are lots of questions to take up later. 

CHAIR:  I am just very conscious of the time, so we might, if it is okay, Senator Canavan, move on. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Yes. 

CHAIR:  I will now call our next witness.

CULLEN, Mr Lucas, Chief Executive Officer, Bitcoin Brisbane Pty Ltd 

[09:51] 

CHAIR:  Welcome. Mr Cullen, I am very conscious of the fact that we are actually quite tight for time, so I 
might ask  you if  you have a brief opening statement and in  your opening statement  you can just outline where 
your area fits so that we make sure we are asking the right questions. 

Mr Cullen:  Sure. Thank you for inviting me to this committee, Mr Chair. Bitcoin Brisbane is a consultancy 
firm that develops bitcoin related software and advises industry on the exciting opportunities and potential pitfalls 
of  digital  currencies.  I  am  also  studying  a  Bachelor  of  Mathematics  at  QUT,  and  I  have  previously  worked 
developing  software  in  the  banking  industryâ€”so  I  think  that  should  answer  where  you  should  target  your 
questions. I was also mining bitcoin in 2011, so I am happy to talk about bitcoin mining and why you should not, 
and, as they say, it is better to sell the shovels to the miners than to mine itself. 

As Mark said, the biggest expense of mining is power. In Australia, we have an abundance of free power in the 
form  of  solar,  and  a  decreasing  feed-in  tariff.  A  potential  industry  could  emerge  by  converting  the  solar  power 
generated during the day into bitcoin when the demand for electricity is low and then using that revenue to buy 
power back from the grid in the evening, thus forming an economical battery. 

While  my  experience  in  digital  currency  is  broad,  today  I  would  like  to  confine  my  opening  remarks  to  the 
technical  characteristics  of  digital  currencies.  The  blockchain  is  a  technology  that  underpins  bitcoin.  Just  as 
TCP/IP  is  the  network  protocol  that  allows  services  such  as  email,  websites  and  Skype  to  run,  the  blockchain 
allows peer-to-peer digital currencies to exist. The blockchain is a distributed public ledger that all actors agree to 
be  the  truth  by  a  decentralised  validation  process  called  'mining',  and  actors  participating  in  validating  a 
transaction are known as 'miners'. The ledger may be thought of in traditional accounting terms as double-entry 
accounting.  However,  in  the  bitcoin  network,  each  and  every  transaction  is  known  by  everyone,  making 
fraudulent transactions impossible. Bitcoin transactions are organised and synchronised without central authority 
into 10-minute chunks called 'blocks'. I will skip this next section because of Mark's comments on it, and I will 
take questions. 

CHAIR:  Okay, Mr Cullen; let us just talk about the business opportunities and industry opportunities. So you 
are saying that in your business you effectively develop product and consultants advise businesses on how to get 
into this space? 

Mr Cullen:  That is correct. 

CHAIR:  Do you want to just outline to us what you see as the growth potential of the business opportunities 
for Australian businesses, firstly, and then, secondly, could you touch on the impact the taxation issue has had on 
those opportunities? 

Mr  Cullen:    In  regard  to  business  opportunities,  what  bitcoin  and  block  chain  technology  allows  is  this 
inversion  of  trust.  As  we  are  seeing,  a  distributed  public  ledger  that  can  be  audited  by  anyone  has  massive 
ramifications. For example, party donations could be audited by the public and could also be audited to see where 
those funds are allocated throughout the system. 

We mentioned earlier a topic called proof of solvency, where we are talking about fractional lending. Because 
a block chain and every transaction is known, you can actually see mathematically and provably the amount of 
funds a company has, so you can actually see whether the company has the capacity to pay your invoices. Again, 
it is a proof of solvency. Those are just a few use cases. 

CHAIR:  What about the potential for the Australian businesses you are consulting with? 

Mr Cullen:  I think we have an extremely good talent pool here in Australia from the software developers. We 
have a good climateâ€”albeit solar powerâ€”to actually encourage miners to participate here and to reduce the cost 
of  electricity.  We  have  decent  broadband  penetration,  which  will  allow  these  services  to  exist.  We  are 
traditionally English-speaking citizens. Most of the bitcoin code is written in English, so we have a competitive 
advantage over other markets, such as India, in developing software products in this space. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Is there any mining happening in Australia any more? 

Mr Cullen:  Yes, there is an ASX listed company called DigitalBTC, who have a mining operation in WA. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Where did you do your mining? On your MacBook? 

Mr Cullen:    We  started  mining  in 2011. A  friend  of  mine  has 10 kilowatt  solar  power,  so  we  are  using  the 

advantage of free electricity to earn bitcoin. 

CHAIR:  Was it profitable?

Mr Cullen:  To put it into perspective, I bought about $3,000 worth of bitcoin mining when bitcoin was $5. It 

would have been more profitable just to buy bitcoin and be up $750,000. 

Senator CANAVAN:  With the increase in the price? 

Mr Cullen:  Yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What is Bitcoin Brisbane's business at the moment? What services do you offer people? 

Mr  Cullen:    It  is  primarily  developing  software  for  bitcoin.  Either  accepting  payments,  as  a  traditional  e-

commerce marketplace, or building software for up-and-coming industries like bitcoin ATMs. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Do you have ATM clients at the moment? 

Mr Cullen:  Yes, we do. We have just finished a development cycle for an ATM client. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Do you know how many ATMs there are in Australia? 

Mr Cullen:  It would be fewer than 10. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Fewer than 10 in the whole country. Where are they? 

Mr  Cullen:    Off  the  top  of  my  head,  there  are  three  in  Melbourne,  one  in  Brisbane  and  I  think  a  couple  in 

Sydney. 

Senator CANAVAN:   Presumably  you are fairly connected in with the bitcoin community.  Is it growing  in 

Australia? Are people using it? Is there data at the moment on the use of bitcoins in Australia, not just globally? 

Mr Cullen:  You could work it out. There is growth. My user group has 200 members. The Sydney meet up 
last  night  well  exceeded  that.  It  is  growing  as  people  are  becoming  aware.  But  one  of  the  biggest  benefits  for 
accepting or using bitcoin is consumer protection. I might quickly talk about that. 

In  a  traditional  system,  when  you  pay  via  credit  card  you  are  literally  handing  your  wallet  to  someone  and 
saying, 'Take out as much funds as you see fit and hand the wallet back to me.' We have legal frameworks to stop 
people  doing  that  but  as  history  shows  that  process  is  flawed. There are  a  lot  of actors  along  the  way  who  can 
maliciously or unintentionally lose that data. Whereas, a bitcoin system is a push system. I will never reveal my 
information to you. You will send me an invoice and I will sign a transaction on my computer using my private 
keys  and  then  push  that  transaction,  unencrypted,  to  the  network  for  every  actor  to  witness.  From  a  merchant 
point, because transactions are for all intents and purposes irreversible, that allows trades to markets or in areas 
that typically would not be acceptable to trade in. I have one client who has done over half a million of consumer 
electrical sales and has zero fraud. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Who is he selling to? 

Mr Cullen:  It is anyone in the world. 

Senator CANAVAN:  He is based in Australia? 

Mr Cullen:  Yes, he is based in Brisbane. He has sold to over 50 countries worldwide and with zero fraud. 

Senator CANAVAN:  He only accepts bitcoins? 

Mr Cullen:  He only accepts bitcoin. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Just on the consumer safety: you are saying that the consumer safety is a selling point 
for bitcoin, I suppose. What are the risks though? We heard earlier about the potential for stealing bitcoins and 
those things. Are they evident in the community now? Do people lose bitcoins? 

Mr  Cullen:    Yes,  that  is  a  good  point.  With  bitcoin,  the  consumer  or  the  user  is  entrusted  with  their  own 
private  keys.  Effectively,  everyone  is  their  own  bank.  That  is  a  scary  and  an  exciting  opportunity.  But  I  would 
argue that a central repository with everyone's data in it that is susceptible to an attack is probably worse than a 
distributed system where everyone's private keys are distributed by themselves. 

The bitcoin protocol has a few things built in to stop loss of data. Mark did not touch on this. They are called 
multisignature  accounts.  We  can  think  of  these  in  a  traditional  model  as  a  joint  account,  so  we  could  have  an 
account that requires, say, two of three signatures. You and your partner could be custodians of the account and 
keep the third signature in a vault et cetera. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What do you mean by signaturesâ€”an electronic type? 

Mr Cullen:  Sorry, I should say 'as private keys'â€”as the keys to sign the transaction. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Like a wi-fi password or something like that? 

Mr Cullen:  You could think of it that way, yes.

Senator CANAVAN:  I think we will hear from the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association their 
proposal for a sort of self-regulatory environment. What do you think of that idea? Obviously we want to protect 
against people doing the wrong thing in this industry. Do you think that kind of model can work, or would you 
prefer other types of regulatory models or just a complete open slather arrangement? 

Mr Cullen:  To be honest, regulatory is not really my expertise. But what I would like to see, and what I am 
doing,  is  educating  people  on  how  to  stop  theft  and  loss  of  bitcoin.  I  think  there  should  be,  maybe  from  a 
government  point,  more  education  into  this  space.  We  talked  brieflyâ€”I  forget  who  asked  the  questionâ€”about 
what this private key is, and Mark touched on it briefly: it is just an arbitrary string of characters. That is correct 
and it also is incorrect. It is just a number. It is literally just a number, albeit a number that is so large that the 
number of combinations to try and guess that number is just not feasible. So I think a broader understanding of 
what the private key is and why that information is sensitive is one of the ways to bring adoption into this space. I 
think that is done through education and through forums like this. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    I  am  going  to  the  issue  that,  if  storing  that  number  then  becomes  an  issueâ€”and  I 

suppose, if I have a lot of bitcoins, I probably do not want to carry them around on a USB stickâ€” 

Mr Cullen:  That is right. 

Senator CANAVAN:  or even on Dropbox or something like that. I would probably want to have them secure 
with  some  kind  of  exchange  or  wallet,  as  we  were  speaking  about  before.  Of  course,  there  was  a  high-profile 
failure earlier in the year with MtGox. 

Mr Cullen:  Yes. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    To  what  extent  do  you  see  the  risk  to  your  industry  of  cowboys,  if  you  like,  in  the 
industry doing the wrong thing and therefore hurting the reputation of everybody in the industry? Is that a great 
risk? 

Mr  Cullen:    Again,  it  is  about  education. There  are  ways,  as  I  said,  to  provably  know  that  that  company  is 
solvent. With MtGox, if they had used a proof of solvency, we could have seen that they did not have the funds 
that they said they did, so people could have had that be transparent. I think exchanges et cetera will take on these 
features and have a competitive edge over their competitors, so you will only do business with an exchange, and it 
will have proof of solvency. By the same token, using a multisignature account, I could jointly sign my coins on 
MtGox and myself, requiring both parties to sign that transaction in the event of an exchange, so no one actor can 
ever spend those coins. So we can avoid scenarios like MtGox through education and through best practices. 

CHAIR:  Can I just follow up on that. I will just go back to what Mr Pesce said earlier, just to get the order 
right.  There  is  the  ledger,  which  is  the  block  chain.  That  has  proven  to  be  incredibly  secure  and  strongâ€”
impenetrable is probably the wrong word, but it has been demonstrated to be a kind of Swiss banking system. It is 
a kind of vault. That has been fine; there has been no issues there and there is faith in that. Separate to that you 
have got the exchanges which stem off that. My interaction with the block chain is through the exchanges, and 
that is where they maintain my wallet and do those kinds of things.  

I am just going to note here that ASIC said that the weak link has been the kind of exchanges. And your point, 
Mr Cullen, is that as we go through this process the competitive nature of the exchanges and market forces will 
mean that the trusted, successful exchanges are the ones that are going to succeed. Of the others, some will fall 
over, some will get bought out and some will get unprofitable.  

But you are effectively saying that what we are going through now is the market forces making a determination 
on  which  of  the  exchanges are  going  to come  to  fruition  and  which  of  the  exchanges  are  going  to  disappearâ€”
vanish.  

Mr Cullen:  I get asked this a lot of times, and it was touched on here today: where do we buy coins from? I 
would  advise  that  we  buy  from  Australian  exchanges  like  CoinJar  or  CoinTree.  They  have  ABN  numbers  and 
they are based in Melbourne so they abide by our laws and regulations. There are other, offshore exchanges but, 
like any purchase on the internet, you have to be diligent. You have to work out who you are dealing with and if 
these companies are reputable. Perhaps you should start small and only risk the amount of money you can afford 
to loseâ€”just like any transaction on the internet. 

CHAIR:  But the point I want to make is that what happened with MtGox was not a reflection on the ledgerâ€”

the block chain. 

Mr Cullen:  No. 

CHAIR:  That was a reflection on the exchange itself. 

Mr Cullen:  That is right.

CHAIR:  I just want to make that distinction, and get my understanding right on that. 

Mr Cullen:  It was run by criminals. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What exactly went wrong with MtGox? How were they able to defraud people? 

Mr  Cullen:    It  was  basically  a  Ponzi  scheme:  I  can  sell  two  people  one  bitcoin  each,  but  I  only  have  one 
bitcoin on my balance sheet. I can make a website that shows them whatever I like, but if they both withdraw that 
one bitcoin, therein lies the problem. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    So  it  was  a  bank  effectively? That  is  exactly  what  the  Commonwealth  Bank  does.  It 

does not have all the money in its vaults to pay everyone out if we all went there today. 

Mr Cullen:  I will decline to comment on that. 

CHAIR:  I think we will leave bank bashing to another time! 

Senator CANAVAN:  That is a different inquiry. 

Mr Cullen:  Exactly right. And using a proof of solvency, we can show that they are 100 per cent solvent for 
the amount of  money. So,  like  you said, using bitcoin actually solves problems that we are seeing today in  the 
banking and financial sector. 

Senator CANAVAN:  And I suppose that is where some would argue that regulation can help in the sense that 
it  is  fine  for  MtGox  or  some  other  entity  to  say,  'Yep,  I'm  solvent;  please  trust  me.'  But  obviously,  when  the 
confirmation is coming from the interested party it will carry less weight, whereas if there was a third party and a 
regulator and a creditor, that could provide some kind of certification stamp and perhaps help the industry. What 
do you think of that potential? 

Mr Cullen:  Sure. Anyone that audits these companies can also make mistakes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Sure. 

Mr Cullen:  And all of these audits come at a cost. With a proof-of-solvency scenario these costs are literally 

zero, and anyone has the potential to do this. So again, these systems should be embraced. 

CHAIR:  There are a few more questions that I would like to ask, and in particular about the recent decision 
by the NAB in April 2014, but I might bring that back to the panel because there might be other views on that as 
well. Thank you, Mr Cullen, for making yourself available.

GUZOWSKI, Mr Christopher, Managing Director, ABA Technology Pty Ltd 

[10:09] 

CHAIR:  Welcome, do you have any comments to make on the capacity in which you appear? 

Mr  Guzowski:    We  operate  bitcoin  ATMs  around  Australia  and  we  are  developing  a  number  of  different 

bitcoin software solutions for consumers and merchants alike. 

CHAIR:    Because  we  are  very  conscious  of  how  limited  our  time  is,  I  am  going  to  ask  you  to  make  some 
opening remarks and in doing soâ€”and you have probably already answered thisâ€”could you explain where your 
expertise and area is so we can make sure we are directing the right set of questions to you? 

Mr Guzowski:  Thank you. Bitcoin, at its most fundamental level, is a breakthrough in computer scienceâ€”one 
that  builds  on  20  years  of  research  into  cryptographic  currency  and  40  years  of  research  in  cryptography.  The 
practical consequence of this breakthrough is that bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one internet user to 
transfer a unique piece of digital property to another internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe 
and  secure,  everyone  knows  that  the  transfer  has  taken  place  and  nobody  can  challenge  the  legitimacy  of  the 
transfer.  Some  have  called  it  the  invention  of  digital  scarcity.  Digital  money  is  the  first  type  of  property  to  be 
transferred  in  this  way.  The  consequences  of  this  breakthrough  are  hard  to  overstate.  Bitcoin's  commercial 
potential  is  extraordinary,  and  we  are  only  just  beginning  to  develop  applications  to  realise  this  potential.  Two 
hundred and ninety-five million dollars of venture capital investment has flown into bitcoin related companies so 
far in 2014. This is significantly more than was invested in internet related companies in 1995. 

The bitcoin ledger is a new kind of payment system. Anyone in the world can pay anyone else in the world any 
amount  of  value  of  bitcoin  by  simply  transferring  ownership  of  the  corresponding  slot  in  the  ledger.  You  put 
value in, transfer it and the recipient gets value outâ€”no intermediary required, no friction and, in most cases, no 
fees. Earlier this year, a random spectator at a televised sports event held up a placard with a QR code and the 
text,  'Send  me  bitcoin.'  He  received  $25,000  in  bitcoin  in  the  first  24  hours,  all  from  people  he  had  never  met. 
This was the first time in history that you could see someone holding up a sign in person, on TV or in a photo and 
then send them money with two clicks on your smartphone. 

CHAIR:  Just before we move on from this, did he explain what he needed the money for, or was it just for his 

own personal use? 

Mr Guzowski:  I think it was a social experiment.  

Senator CANAVAN:  Is this hearing televised, Chair? Can I do the same! 

Mr Guzowski:  I would like to demonstrate this happening live, later on, if you give me the opportunity. The 
fact  that  bitcoin  has  almost  no  fees  is  extremely  important.  Bitcoin  is  the  first  internet-wide  payment  system 
where transactions either happen with no fees or with very low fees, down to fractions of a cent. Existing payment 
systems charge fees of two to three per cent due to friction incurred by multiple intermediaries in the transaction 
process. 

What is the future of bitcoin? Why would any merchant want to accept bitcoin as payment? Venture capitalist, 
Netscape  founder  and  big  bitcoin  advocate,  Marc  Andreessen,  has  given  the  example  of  an  online  electronics 
retailer. Profit margins for many online retailers are under five per cent, which means that conventional 2Â½ per 
cent  payment  fees  consume  half  the  margin.  Bitcoin's  frictionless  nature  means  that  this  money  could  be 
reinvested  in  the  business,  passed  back  to  consumers  or  taxed  by  the  government.  Australian  online  retailers 
marketing to an offshore market particularly lose competitiveness due to even higher international payment fees. 
To give you a feel for this market, e-commerce sales in 2014 are forecast to top $1Â½ trillion. 

One  immediately  obvious  and  enormous  area  for  bitcoin  based  innovation  is  international  remittance.  Every 
day hundreds of millions of low-income people go to work in hard jobs in foreign countries to make money to 
send back to their families in their home countries. Over 600 billion was forecast by the World Bank for this year 
alone. Every day, banks and payment companies extract exorbitant fees, often upward of 10 per cent, to transfer 
this  money.  Bitcoin,  with  little  to  no  fees  and  no  intermediaries,  will  make  remittance  costs  negligible.  To  be 
clear, this usage of bitcoin alone will produce an economic saving approaching $60 billion annually. 

A third fascinating use for bitcoin is micropayments. Micropayments have never been feasible, because it is not 
cost-effective  to  process  small  payments  through  the  existing  credit,  debit  and  banking  systemsâ€”think  of 
payments of one dollar and below, down to fractions of a cent. All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, that is easy. Bitcoins 
have the useful property of infinite divisibility, currently down to eight decimal places, so you can specify a very 
small amount of money, like a thousandth of a cent, and send it to anyone in the world for free.

Content monetisation is a great example. One reason media businesses such as newspapers struggle to charge 
for online content is that they need to charge either allâ€”the entire subscription fee for all the contentâ€”or nothing, 
which  then  results  in  all  the  terrible  banner  ads  on  the  internet.  All  of  a  sudden,  with  bitcoin,  there  is  an 
economically  viable  way  to  charge  otherwise  small  amounts  of  money  per  article,  per  section,  per  hour  or  per 
video play et cetera. 

I hope that I have given you a sense of the incredibly exciting promise of bitcoin. Bitcoin offers a plethora of 
opportunity  to  reimagine  how  the  financial  system  can  and  should  work  in  the  internet  era  and  a  catalyst  to 
reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals, government and business alike. I am happy to 
take questions. 

CHAIR:  That was fantastic. Thank you so much for thatâ€”that was a really good opening statement. I want to 
touch on a couple of the specific points you made because they are quite interesting. I had not heard this before. 
In talking about the content, you say that the broader challenge is how you have a newspaper-video industry that 
is sustainable. At the moment, the way we have been doing it is by paying a monthly subscription fee of, say, $10, 
$20  or  $30,  depending  on  the  supplier.  You  are  saying  that  this  would  be  an  opportunity  to  have  a  whole 
micropaymentâ€”a new way of being held to pay for content and to sustain comment. 

Mr  Guzowski:    A  pay-per-view  system  where  you  could  pay  5c  to  read  an  articleâ€”and  that  is,  literally, 

scanning a QR code, pressing a button and having access. 

CHAIR:  That is really interesting. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Is anybody doing that right now? 

Mr Guzowski:  There are a few players doing it at the moment, but there are a number of significant media 

organisations looking into it. 

CHAIR:  Any of the Australian media organisations? 

Mr Guzowski:  We are in discussions with a number of Australian media organisations. 

CHAIR:  I do not want to embarrass you to name them, so I will not ask you to do that. 

Mr Guzowski:  Thank you. 

CHAIR:  I assume that is commercial-in-confidence. Apart from the Australian media players, are there other 

kinds of industries that you are looking at that seem quite innovative and different? 

Mr Guzowski:  The bitcoin businesses are numerousâ€”from bitcoin exchanges to bitcoin broking services to 
services  for  merchants  to  accept  bitcoin.  There  are  financial  services  around  bitcoin  with  derivatives  to  help 
mitigate the risk and bitcoin mining, which is to facilitate the reconciliation and clearing of payments, which was 
touched on before. 

CHAIR:  Where is most of the mining done now? In a discussion earlier it was said that somebody is doing it 
in WA and, I think, someone is doing it in Brisbane. Is most of it done in the US? Where in the world is most of 
this happening? 

Mr Guzowski:  It is very much driven by power cost because that is the main operational cost of performing 
bitcoin mining. I believe that there are large mining operations in Iceland because Iceland has plentiful renewable 
energy from geothermal sources, which is essentially free because the capex has been paid off. They also have a 
cool  climate,  which  allows  for  the  natural  cooling  of  the  machines,  which  heat  up,  and  it  means  there  is  no 
additional cost for air conditioning. I believe there is a lot of mining being done in Texas and in Washington state 
in the US as well. 

CHAIR:  You run ATMs. 

Mr Guzowski:  That is right. 

CHAIR:  Where are your ATMs? 

Mr Guzowski:  We have one in Westfield Sydney in Pitt Street Mall. 

CHAIR:  I have seen that one. 

Mr Guzowski:  Pitt Street Mall is the fifth most expensive retail street in the world, for the record. 

CHAIR:  You can come to our retail leasing inquiry next week if you want! 

Mr Guzowski:  We have one in the Emporium in Melbourne and we have one here in the Canberra Centre. 

CHAIR:    How  does  it  work?  I  have  seen  the  machine;  I  have  not  used  it.  If  I  go  to  this  machine  will  you 
convert? If I do not already have a walletâ€”not knowing the answer to this is going to make me sound really silly, 
so I apologiseâ€”can I go in with $20 and put it through your machine and it will get put into my wallet as bitcoin?

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

Mr  Guzowski:    That  is  right.  Our ATM  is  almost  like  a  foreign  exchange  kiosk, but  it  is  automated;  it  is  a 
piece  of  hardware.  Somebody  can  go  up  to  the  ATM  and  purchase  bitcoin  the  cash.  They  scan  their  QR  code, 
which is their bitcoin address, or we can printâ€” 

CHAIR:  Is that their wallet? 

Mr  Guzowski:    That  is  their  wallet.  They  nominate  where  that  bitcoin  is  sent.  They  enter  the  cash  into  the 
machine, confirm the  transaction and it is sent immediately to their wallet. Alternatively,  they can send  bitcoin 
they already own to the machine, essentially selling it, which we then, as an agent on their behalf, sell on the open 
market. And it can dispense cash for them, so they can both liquidate their bitcoin holdings and purchase bitcoin 
through the machine. We identify our users before they can transact with the machine. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What you mean by identify? How does that happen? 

Mr Guzowski:  We scan their ID, we take a photo of them and we verify that the two things match up before 

we allow them to transact. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Why do you do that? What is the risk? 

Mr  Guzowski:    We  do  that  to  pre-emptively  comply  with  anti-money-laundering  and  counterterrorism 
financing  regulation.  We  know  that  bitcoin  is  still  in  regulatory  limbo  in  Australia,  but  we  are  pre-emptively 
being compliant to prove the legitimacy of the technology. 

CHAIR:  On that point, I am going to quote. As part of this inquiry, we will obviously be approaching them 
the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC. I imagine I would be very surprised if they 
did not come to a future hearing. They have expressed concern about the risk that digital currencies could pose to 
finance terrorists or other nefarious kinds of activities. I guess there are two questions. Firstly, how legitimate a 
concern is that? They will have their opinion. Secondly, if it is a legitimate concern, what is the best way that you 
feel you can address the risk of digital currencies being used in this way? 

Mr Guzowski:  Sure. It is a legitimate concern. It is of similar concern to how cash can be used, honestly. 

CHAIR:  All I know is that it is by bank accounts. 

Mr Guzowski:  However, all bitcoin transactions go through the bitcoin ledger. Therefore, it is fully auditable. 
That is why we have discussed as the ADCCAâ€”of which our company is a founding memberâ€”that there should 
be oversight on the on ramps and off ramps into bitcoinâ€”that is, when people by bitcoin and sell bitcoin. So that 
if we identify the user that is buying and selling bitcoin, thereafter there is a transferâ€” 

CHAIR:  That is with exchanges. 

Mr Guzowski:  Exchanges or ATO or other vending services of bitcoin. 

CHAIR:  ATMs are an exchange, are not they? 

Mr Guzowski:  No, we are an agent to an exchange. So we are just a facilitator for bitcoin transactions. 

CHAIR:  Fair enough. So just with a comparison to the normal banking world, you are like what Diebold is in 

builds of the ATMs. 

Mr Guzowski:    No, we are practically like a Travelex for bitcoin which is  unmanned, which makes it more 

efficient. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    So  whatâ€”I  am  ignorant  of  all  thisâ€”requirements  are  on  Travelex  at  the  moment  to 

record and report the transactions they facilitate in various foreign currencies? 

Mr Guzowski:  I am not a regulation compliance expert, but when I used to Travelex last, they asked me to 
present  my  ID.  So  I  identified  myself  before  transacting  with  them  and  I  did  not  pay  GST  on  the  Australian 
dollars or the US dollars.  

Senator CANAVAN:  So you require the ID. Have you had any requests from law enforcement authorities to 

provide details? 

Mr Guzowski:  I am not privy to disclose that, unfortunately. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I am not asking for the details of that. 

CHAIR:  What was the question? 

Senator CANAVAN:  I  just asked has he had a request to disclose information from a regulatory authority. 

Mr  Guzowski:    However,  we  have  met  with  law  enforcement  officials  on  a  number  of  occasions  and 

expressed our wont to cooperate with any requestâ€” 

 

ECONOMICS REFERENCES COMMITTEE 

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

Senate 

Page 23 

Senator CANAVAN:  That was going to be not my next question. Do you have in place any guidelines about 

that reporting within your business at the moment? 

Mr Guzowski:  We have full transaction reporting in place which, if required by law, we could supply like to 

law enforcement. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What sort of threshold or triggers to think you would need to provide that information? 

Would it be just simply a request from an authority? 

Mr Guzowski:  We compile that information regardless of the transaction size. It is all software so it is all very 
easy to program into our workflow and I guess that is why, as the ADCCA, we are trying to have a conversation 
about  ideally  a  self-regulatory  framework,  where  we  put  standards  on  the  industry  and  we  implement  those 
standards in the software, in the workflows when the industry is starting, rather than have some standards come in 
place  or  regulations  come  into  place  when  the  industry  is  already  in  full  swing,  which  is  much  harder  to 
implement and will cause disruption to services. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Presumably here there is a balance between the privacy of people's information that you 

hold and their transactions and the requirements of various authorities as far as privacy goes. 

Mr Guzowski:  We maintain best practice as far as privacy goes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So how much workâ€”I am sure this is a question we are going to ask the organisation 
you are a member of later. How much work have it done in trying to design best practice guidelines around the 
protection of privacy but with cooperation. 

Mr  Guzowski:    As  the  ADCCA  we  have  been  working  very  hard  discussing  it  with  professionals  in  the 
compliance field, experts in the payment space and experts in financial services compliance to come up with the 
most effective self-regulatory framework. 

CHAIR:  Going back to the scenario I gave you earlier, I want to get the taxation issue clear. If I go to your 
ATM in the food court in Westfield in Pitt Street and put $20 into the machine to convert it to bitcoin so that I can 
pay for something, in doing so the Australian Taxation Office will charge me 10 per cent GST on the transaction. 

Mr Guzowski:  If we were selling our customers' bitcoin we would apply 10 per cent GST, as per the recent 
ATO ruling. However, as an Australian company, we do not sell our customers' bitcoin. We facilitate for them to 
purchase bitcoin from overseas vendors, and just provide the technology to do that. We charge a margin on the 
bitcoin, a spread, and we charge GST on that. 

CHAIR:    I want to highlight the  ridiculousness of the taxation issue. There may be an argument put that by 
having this there was a revenue opportunity for the Australian government by charging 10 per cent GST on these 
transactions. The point you are making is that the simple global nature of all this means that you would not be 
competitive if you were going to an Australian processor. You have to go through an international process to be 
internationally competitive. 

Mr Guzowski:  My take on the GST ruling is that it has caused a lot of confusion in the industry. On the one 
hand it has created clarity because they have created some definition of bitcoin and classed it as an international 
asset.  But  on  the  other  hand  putting  GST  on  it  has  meant  that  it  puts  additional  friction  on  transactions  and  it 
completely sets it apart from other types of currency and does not make it practical to purchase locally. So, yes, it 
has sent a lot of businesses offshore. It is putting a brake on the industry, for sure. 

CHAIR:  I just want to note the presence of Senator Whish-Wilson. I note that the Senate is sitting, so he may 

have to come and go. 

Senator CANAVAN:  To finish up on the chair's questions and this issue about the fact you are not charging 

GST when I go to one of your ATMs and buy bitcoinâ€” 

Mr Guzowski:  We are charging GST on our services. 

Senator CANAVAN:  But if I buy bitcoin from you? 

Mr Guzowski:  You are not buying bitcoin from me. The machine is facilitating for an overseas seller to sell it 

into the Australian market. 

CHAIR:  And the reason you are not using Australian sellers is that it would cost you 10 per cent more? 

Mr Guzowski:  That is right. That is what I was going to clarify. 

Senator CANAVAN:  It goes to the issue Mr Sommer raised earlier about this being inconsistent. 

Mr Guzowski:  Could I demonstrate a bitcoin transaction using software that we built here in Australia, and 

we have been working for six months to do it. I want to demonstrate the exciting nature of it. 

 

ECONOMICS REFERENCES COMMITTEE 

Page 24 

Senate 

Wednesday, 26 November 2014 

A software demonstration was then shownâ€” 

Mr  Guzowski:    I  am  showing  you  on  my  computer  a  web  site  that  accepts  bitcoin  as  a  means  of  payment. 
Also, I have on my phone a wallet that we have developed, and I am going to send bitcoin from my wallet to the 
web site, which could be any person or merchant anywhere around the world. I press a button to scan a QR code. 
The scanner pops up and I scan that. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Does it work through NFC? 

Mr Guzowski:  It will very shortly. It has now been scanned in and I press send. I enter my code, as security, 
and it is sending. A tick just popped up on the screen showing the payment has been received and the transaction 
has gone through. That is the same service that Visa and MasterCard perform for a large transaction fee. It is the 
same service PayPal, an American company, performs. They process $300 million in transactions a day. Because 
of  the  Bitcoin  technology,  an  Australian  company  based  in  Sydney,  using  local  talent  has  developed  this 
technology,  which  allows  merchants  to  accept  payments  from  all  around  the  world  for  free,  immediately, 
securely. That is a very exciting development and something that we have developed here in Australia. That is 
something we could champion, if we pioneered self-regulation in this industry and our financial institutions could 
go out and expand their customer base in the regional markets providing this technology, which is so easy to use 
and can provide financial services to a whole host of new customers. 

CHAIR:    You  said  before  'for  free'â€”I  assumed  that  there  was  some  kind  of  nominal  transaction  charge, 

because how else are you making money? 

Mr Guzowski:  No. From now our point of view, we provide this service and it is a question of developing this 
serviceâ€”we will charge the merchants a monthly fee for allowing them  to not be charged a per transaction fee. 
There  is  a  clear  business  case  for  a  merchant  to  use  our  services  because  they  open  up  to  a  new  market  of  the 
Bitcoin community, they do not get charged a transaction fee and they get charged a very nominal monthly fee for 
the service. There is a clear business case for them. Then consumers can do it for free.  

A consumer can voluntarily add a so-called minus fee, which is fractions of a cent, to expedite a transactionâ€”
that is really a technicality. The way the network is financed is through mining and the miners, by the network, 
are remunerated with 25 newly-issued bitcoins every 10 minutes for solving the algorithm and ordering the block 
chain.  That service is reconciling all the transactions that occurred in the last 10 minutes, it is a clearing house 
function and mild inflation of the number of bitcoins issuedâ€”that is how the system is financed rather than on a 
per transaction basis. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  Mr Guzowskiâ€”nice mo by the way. 

Mr Guzowski:  Thank you, Senator. I believe the Movember Foundation will be accepting bitcoin next year. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  Good. Has there been any development in the secondary market for bitcoin, like 

derivative markets? 

Mr Guzowski:  There are, and there are fascinating Australian companies that are developing such financial 
productsâ€”I will plug  my friend  Jeremy Glaros  at Coinarch, who are ex-Macquarie bankers who have resigned 
from their very high-profile jobs to innovate in this space; they are a Sydney-based company who are developing 
products to mitigate risk for merchants and consumers to be able to hedge the volatility risk of Bitcoin and make 
it a safer environment, and to meet different users' needs. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON: Can you give us a breakdown or do you have any data at all about the volatility 

of Bitcoin in connection with it being used for transactions rather than speculation? 

Mr Guzowski:  It is difficult to break down what volume of transactions is transactional volume and what is 
transaction volumeâ€”it is just as difficult, as it is on the oil market, to define which oil trades are actually by end 
users and which ones are by financial speculators. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  It is, yes. 

Mr Guzowski:  The fact is that there are about $100 million of transactions going through the block chain on a 
daily basis and the volatility, I last heard, has dropped from 10 per cent on a daily basis two years ago and five per 
cent last  year down to two  per cent daily this  yearâ€”there is clearly a downward  trend in the volatility. That is 
because more exchanges are opening up around the world, there are more traders, there are more market makers, 
there  is  more  market  depth,  more  liquidity  and  therefore  the  spreads  are  being  lowered  and  the  volatility  is 
reducing. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  Have you approached the ASX at all or have you had briefings with the ASX at 

all about potential trading platforms for Bitcoin? 

 

ECONOMICS REFERENCES COMMITTEE

Mr  Guzowski:    Not  yet.  Personally,  I  have  not  had  those  discussions  with  the  ASX.  However,  there  is 
definitely potential for such discussions and their use of this technology, but I would hazard a guess that that is a 
few years down the line. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  I figure if financial markets can start pricing the risk and are comfortable with 
pricing that riskâ€”particularly, in liquid secondary marketsâ€”then you are on your way to getting it accepted for 
transactions. I am not sure how far advanced you are in that respect. 

Mr Guzowski:   I am expecting a number of exchanges to develop in Australia servicing the local market. It 
would be pure speculation to say that they would be cooperating more or less with established players, but I am 
sure they are keeping their eye on this space. 

Senator  WHISH-WILSON:    On  speculation,  have  you  heard  any  rumours  about  Launceston  becoming  a 

potential exchange? 

Mr Guzowski:  I may have read an article or two. 

CHAIR:  I was not aware of that. Mr Guzowski, there is going to be a panel discussion later today, which I 
believe you are participating in. I am very conscious of time and the fact that we have on the line Ms Perianne

BORING, Ms Perianne, President and Founder, Chamber of Digital Commerce (USA) 

[10:35] 

Evidence was taken via teleconferenceâ€” 

CHAIR:  Welcome, Ms Boring. Thank you for participating in our inquiry, and I really appreciate you making 
the effort to help us. To give you a very quick background of what we are doing in Australia, for the first time we 
have started Senate hearings into the future of digital currency, and we are exploring not only the business and 
other opportunities in the Australian context but to what and extent and in what way should we be shaping our 
regulations and rules in the Australian domestic context, and where we have it right and where we have it wrong. 
I know there are going to be a fair few questions from senators, but before we go to questions, do you have any 
opening remarks or an opening statement that you would like to make? 

Ms  Boring:    Yes,  I  do.  Thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  testify  via  teleconference.  I  think  it  is  extremely 
important for public policy  makers to engage with industry on digital assets and digital currencies because it is 
important for dialogue between the two. I am the president and the founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. 
We are a 501(c)(6) trade association representing the digital asset and digital currency industries. Our mission is 
to  educate  and  facilitate  the  dialogue  with  policy  makers  and  regulators  to  advocate  for  a  pro-growth  legal 
framework  that  is  also  consistent  with  the  best  interests  of  the  public.  We  do  this  through  a  three-pronged 
approach: (1) advocacy; (2) public affairs; and (3) by building an organising the digital assets community. 

Firstly, our advocacy efforts focus on educating public policy makers and regulators on the potential benefits of 
digital  assets  such  as  block chain  technology  to  protect  future  and  promote  further  innovation.  Our  view  at  the 
chamber is that block chain technology is revolutionary  and could soon be fundamental to the world's financial 
systems because it has the potential to make commerce easier, more transparent, has lower transaction costs and 
harvests the power of the internet to unlock a whole new level of digital commerce. Our advocacy efforts here in 
Washington,  DC  include  proactively  building  strategic  relationships  with  public  policy  makers  through  open 
dialogue  and  facilitate  public  policy  makers  education  on  digital  currency  and  it  benefits,  and  reinforcing  the 
industries that occasion to grow in the economy in a legal and ethical way. Our main focus is with US congress 
and US federal agencies and departments that have jurisdiction over this technology. 

Secondly, we also provide public affairs services to help shape the public perception of the industry  through 
responsive and proactive media engagement. We believe the media plays a very important role in public policy 
making, and in the US we have found that there has been a lot of misinformation about this technology. We work 
with the media and with the public to sort out the facts and to provide real-time responses to crucial developments 
or updates. 

Thirdly,  we  are  working  to  encourage  widespread  adoption,  by  building  third-party  coalitions.  We  seek  out 
small businesses and merchant and consumer organisations that have found value in the payment protocol, and we 
drive them to advocate and support this technology on their own behalf. We are also working to bridge the gap 
between  the  traditional  financial  institutions  and  the  digital  currency  industry.  In  summary,  we  are  a  business 
league that helps facilitate open and transparent dialogue with public policymakers. 

Just  as  government  wants  open,  transparent,  safe  and  stable  markets,  so  do  we.  Therefore  we  have  a  mutual 
interest in working together. Just as the internet is to communication, we believe digital assets will be to currency 
and  commerce.  There  will  be  stumbles  along  the  wayâ€”we  have  already  seen  someâ€”and,  as  our  lives  are 
becoming  more  and  more  digitised,  it  is  important  that  consumers  have  a  safe  way  to  store  and  move  digital 
assets.  As  technology  is  changing  the  world,  commerce  has  to  evolve  with  it.  I  am  happy  to  take  any  of  your 
questions. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Thank you very much for that, Ms Boring. We very much appreciate you joining us by 

teleconference. I presume it is the evening over there, is it? 

Ms Boring:  It is Tuesday night at 6.40. 

Senator CANAVAN:  That is not too bad; it has worked out pretty well. I should say that the chair, Senator 
Dastyari, has just stepped out, but I am Senator Matthew Canavan. I also have here at the table Senator Whish-
Wilson from Tasmania, and I am sure we both have some questions. Can I just start by asking you to outline how 
US regulatory authorities define and approach Bitcoin and other digital currencies at the moment? I do not know 
if you heard any of the testimony this morning, but we particularly focused on taxation issues. How, in generalâ€”
and in particularâ€”with regard to tax, do the US authorities regulate digital currencies? 

Ms Boring:  On your first question about the regulatory environment and how public policymakers are looking 
at  this  technology,  I  will  first  say  we  have  a  very  bad  recipe  for  public  policy  making  at  the  moment,  because

there have been some scandals, some mishaps and some road bumps. I am sure you have heard of them all, from 
Silk  Roadâ€”I  know  in  Australia  you  had  your  own  Silk  Road-type  website  issues.  There  was  the  fall  of  Mt. 
Goxâ€”I  heard  somebody  else  speak  about  Mt.  Gox  this  morning  at  your  hearing  as  wellâ€”and  then  Liberty 
Reserve was another bad actor that created tons of media attention.  

The  media is creating hype around these scandals. They are not focusing on the positive aspects of how this 
technology  is  benefiting  the  economy.  Regulators  feel  like  they  have  to  do  something,  because  they  have  been 
tasked  with  implementing  consumer  and  investor  protections,  but  yet  they  do  not  have  a  full  understanding  of 
how  this  technology  works.  In  fact  there  are  very  few  people  that  really  understand  blockchain  technology, 
because it is so new. So that is not a good recipe for public policymaking. That is why we came about forming the 
Chamber of Digital Commerce, to start working with public policymakers and educating them on what this is, to 
address their public policy concerns. 

In  the  US,  on  the  federal  level,  we  have  identified  about  10  federal  agencies  and  departments  that  somehow 
have asserted jurisdiction over this technology. I will go through a couple of them. You have the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that is looking at putting securities regulation and laws on this technology. Then you have 
the  IRS,  our  taxing  agent,  which  is  calling  this  property.  Then  you  have  FinCEN,  which  is  a  department 
underneath the US Treasury that is looking at this under money transmissionâ€” 

Senator CANAVAN:  Can you just repeat that last one? I got the IRS; what was the next one after that? 

Ms  Boring:    FinCEN,  the  Financial  Crimes  Enforcement  Networkâ€”it  is  underneath  the  Treasury.  They 
oversee  money  laundering,  so  they  regulate  money  transmission.  There  is  very,  very  tight  regulation  on  top  of 
those  types  of  activities.  They  regulate  Bitcoin  like  a  currency.  We  also  have  the  Commodity  Futures  Trading 
Commission, which is looking at this as a commodity. Then you have the intelligence agencies that are looking at 
this from their own respective views. 

That is just the beginning of all the different agencies here in the US that are looking at this through their own 
lenses. This is a problem because it potentially could create a patchwork of inconsistencies among laws if every 
single agency  wants to regulate this from their own different direction.  It also can create a conflict of law, and 
there are a number of issues that can arise because of that. So it is getting quite complicated. 

On the taxing side, you have the IRS, our taxing agent, calling this property, but if you have the IRS looking at 
this  like  currency  you  have  issues,  if  there  were  any  type  of  criminal  activity,  of  how  they  will  deal  with  that, 
because that is the conflict of law. 

Senator CANAVAN:    I just want to drill down a little. To  clarify,  you said that the IRS  has defined digital 

currencies as property. Is that what you said? 

Ms Boring:  Yes, that is correct. That means, if you acquire bitcoins, whether you bought them or were paid in 
them or came across them, from the time you add them to your wallet to the time they exit your wallet you have 
to report capital gains or losses. It adds a number of reporting complications to dealing with this digital asset. It 
adds more onerous reporting requirements for users of bitcoin. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I know you do not have a VAT, a value-added tax, at a federal level, but you do have 
sales  taxes  at  state  levels,  I  understand. How  have  state  authorities  defined  digital  currencies  or  bitcoin,  just  in 
general, of course? 

Ms Boring:  Did you say state authorities? 

Senator CANAVAN:  Yes, state government. I believe you have sales taxes at the state level. We have heard 
this morning that, in Australia, a tax called the GST, which is effectively a sales tax, has been imposed on bitcoin 
since August. What is the definition in the United States? 

Ms  Boring:    That  is  a  good  question  and  I  am  not  sure  that  this  question  has  made  its  way  into  the  state 
regulatory process at this point. I have not heard anything of different states looking to tax this in different ways. 
We mostly focus on the federal government, so I am not that closely attuned to the state issues. However, money 
transmission  is  regulated  on  a  federal  and  a  state  level,  similar  to  our  taxes.  That  is  causing  a  major  issue  for 
exchangersâ€”any type of bitcoin exchangeâ€”because, in order to operate an exchange in the US, you have to have 
a money transmission licence in every single state that you have customers. That creates a massive barrier to entry 
for a bitcoin exchange. It could take years to become fully licensed in the US in every single state and it could 
take multimillions of dollars. That is an issue that we are taking very, very seriously because it is very difficult for 
an exchange to become established and to be compliant and legal in the United States. The  barriers to entry  to 
offer  this  type  of  service  to  the  industry  are  very  massive  and  there  are  very  few  players  doing  this  within  the 
confines of the laws. That is dangerous. In order to have a healthy and balanced economy, you need start-ups and 
you  need  small  businesses,  but  the  way  that  it  is  operating  at  state  level  provides  very  little  flexibility  for  new

companies or small business, which leads to oligopolies, cartels and monopolies, which is very dangerous and not 
something that fosters healthy economic growth. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  Could I ask you to clarify something, please. Does all that you were saying there 
apply  to  bitcoin?  My  understanding  was  that  it  is  a  completely  open  financial  network  and  does  not  have  the 
restrictions  of  a  lot  of  those  complex  rules.  Is  that  correct  or  are  bitcoin  exchanges  or  financial  services  being 
developed around bitcoin subject to the same rules and restrictions that other financial services are? 

Ms  Boring:    A  lot  of  that  is  currently  being  decided.  What  is  very  difficult  is  that  bitcoin  is  in  block  chain 
technology. It is not just a currency; it is also a payment network. You have a decentralised public ledger which 
also  is  moving  financial  assets  over  the  web.  Any  time  you  are  moving  or  transmitting  money  it  is  highly 
regulated,  especially  in  the  US.  There  are  some  companies  that  are  helping  facilitate  that  process.  Some  of  the 
companies  operating  in  the  States  are  simply  software  providers  and  they  do  not  actually  touch  any  money  or 
financial  assets  or  the  bitcoins.  They  do  not  hold  the  keys  to  the  customers'  accounts;  therefore,  they  are  not 
operating  as  custodians.  It  is  difficult  for  those  policymakers  who  are  looking  to  regulate  this  because  this  is  a 
whole  new  way  to  do  digital  commerce.  We  completely  take  the  traditional  finance  system  and  put  it  upside 
down, and then we have customers dabbling in the financial services area that is very, very strictly regulatedâ€”so 
we are seeing a lot of issues and conflicts of law here. It is a big problem. I would say the biggest problems are 
with  exchanges  and  money  transmission  and  how  customers  can  buy  and  sell  bitcoin.  There  are  some  serious 
regulatory challenges we are still looking to overcome. 

Senator  WHISH-WILSON:    Do  you  see  those  future  regulatory  challenges  then  as  an  opportunity  or  as  a 
problem for the development of bitcoin? Given potential perceptions around volatility, potential theft, the use of 
the services by criminals et cetera, do you see that regulation as an opportunity or a challenge? 

Ms Boring:  It is absolutely a challenge. I will say that every function of our lives is going digitalâ€”there is no 
putting this genie back in the bottle. Blockchain technology is a safer, more efficient means of digital commerce. 
The problem is that regulation, if we do not get public policy right, is going to make it a very long, slow, painful 
process, and I think the next 12 to 15 months here in the US are going to be extremely crucial for the adoption of 
bitcoin.  I  think  adoption  of  bitcoin  is  absolutely  inevitable;  the  only  way  you  can  stop  it  is  by  turning  off  the 
internet or turning off the global power supply. There is no getting rid of it. But it could be an extremely painful 
process if there is an extreme amount of friction during the regulatory process, which is beginning to form now. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  In terms of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, could you give us an update on 
how many businesses, for example, through BitPay or other, are using bitcoin, and what sort of daily transactions 
we are now seeing on the network? 

Ms Boring:  The industry is growing extremely fast. The last time that I looked at these numbersâ€”and it has 
been a couple of weeks, so they might be out of date even at this pointâ€”there were over 100,000 merchants who 
were accepting bitcoin for payment. Those are just the ones that we know about; any company can print out and 
start a bitcoin  wallet and be accepting bitcoins within five  minutes. Not everything  is reported, but  I think it is 
important to know that these numbers are growing exponentially. Another important number and statistic to look 
at is the amount of venture capital money that is going in at this stage. This year alone close to $300 million of 
VC money has gone into bitcoin-related companies; that far outweighs what we saw go into the internet during 
the earliest booms of the internet. This is a very important measure for where innovation is going and where we 
are going to see future growth. 

Senator  WHISH-WILSON:    Have  you  got  any  sense  of  whether  that  liquidity  is  getting  more  transaction 

based or whether it is investment based? 

Ms Boring:  I still think we are in the extremely early days of bitcoin. If bitcoin were a city, we would be just 
laying the pavement of the roadâ€”we do not have lines on the road yet, there are very few cars operating on this 
road, we probably do not have lights yet and there is a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built in order for the 
end user to be able to drive mainstream adoption and for it to be end-user friendly, and we are still quite a way 
away from that. I think we are making extreme progress and the industry has grown in unrecognisable amounts 
just in the time that I have been involved in this space, which has been about two years. So, again, I do not think 
you  can  put  the  genie  back in  the  bottle.  I  definitely  think  that  this  is  a  better  way  for  commerce  and  that  it  is 
going  to  create  jobs  and  allow  for  further  innovation,  growth  and  capital  flows.  It  is  something  that  we  do  not 
want  to  put  at  risk.  It  is  taking  time  to  lay  the  groundwork  and  it  is  important  that  we  do  that  deliberately.  I 
believe that there is a role for government in providing the guardrails to make sure that we have safe and stable 
markets. We are making extreme progress that is extremely impressive.

Senator  CANAVAN:    We  are  looking  at  the  Australian  regulatory  situation,  but  do  you  see  issues  that  go 
across borders? Does there need to be coordination amongst regulatory authorities and major developed countries 
to set some kind of global standard for regulationâ€”would that be of use? 

Ms Boring:  I think that is a great point that you bring up, and it is very important that the G20 countries set 
the tone and the standardâ€”just like we have done for the current financial systemâ€”so we can build a platform 
that is safe, secure and is going to foster an environment for trade and growth. Bitcoin is a global phenomenon. It 
has no bounds, and it is important that the G20 countries work together to foster a playing field that sets a tone 
that fosters international trade. 

CHAIR:  Ms Boring, your broad premise, which some of us accept, is that there is an inevitability to digital 
currency  and  that  Bitcoin  is  probably  the  most  effective  and  likely  digital  currencyâ€”if  there  is  going  to  be  a 
digital currency. Can you explain what you then see as the first-mover opportunities and advantages for a country 
like Australia, and perhaps also what the first-mover risks are? That is what we are trying to assess. There is an 
inevitability that it is going to happen anyway, so there is an argument that says, 'Would it be in our interests to be 
out in front on this; or should we wait to see where America and other places go first?' 

Ms Boring:  I think it depends on what you mean by getting ahead in this. Are you looking at putting forward 

regulation? 

CHAIR:    If we were one of the first of the G20 OECD nations to turn around and say  that we are going to 
have in place a regulatory frameworkâ€”not just let Bitcoin fit into the framework that it exists in by rulings and 
what  not,  which  looks  to  be  the  path  that  the  UK  is  going  downâ€”and  then,  in  order  to  foster  business  and 
opportunity  here  in  Australia,  actively  try  to  create  a  framework  that  fits  around  the  fact  that  this  is  somewhat 
different  and  unique,  my  take  would  be  that  there  will  be  two  sets  of  arguments.  There  will  be  those  who  say, 
'Yes,  we  should  come  out.'  The  Bitcoin  community  in  Australia  will  obviously  make  the  case  and  say  that  we 
should  come  out  lead  on  this  and  provide  the  best  framework.  There  will  be  others,  perhaps  on  the  regulatory 
front, who will say, 'Hang on. The Americans do this stuff very well. Other Western European nations are quite 
good in this space. Why not let them move first, and then we can follow behind?' 

Ms Boring:  I think the technology is still very nascent, and striking a balance within a pro-growth regulatory 
framework  that  does  not  hinder  innovation  is  extremely  tricky.  There  is  a  role  for  government,  and  there  have 
been states within the United States that have come out, who wanted to be a first-mover on this. But they risked 
overregulation, and there have been some unintended consequences of that. For example, two of the most well-
funded companies in the United States came forward and rejected this regulation. They said that they would not 
do business or serve customers in those jurisdictions, because they got it wrong.  

I think it is really difficult to put forward a regulatory framework this early, and the US made some very great 
moves in the beginning stages of the internet by allowing the internet technology to grow and flourish before we 
started putting comprehensive regulation out there. 

I  think,  if  you  want  to  invite  this  technology  into  your  jurisdiction,  the  best  way  to  do  that  is  to  provide 
regulatory clarity in existing laws, especially with the money transmission laws that can hinder these new systems 
in  coming  in  and  flourishing.  I  would  go  through  and  clarify  which  types  of  financial  laws  apply  to  these 
technology companies and which ones do not. Again, even that can be very tricky to do, but I think it has to be an 
extremely  thoughtful  process  because  it  is  such  a  new  technology  that  very  few  people  understand  it.  I  do  not 
think anybody even knows where it is going to go, because it has such a huge growth potential, and you do not 
want to put at risk the innovation, jobs and capital flows that could come from that. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  Could I pull you up on something you just said about new technologies. When 
we look at standard currencies that are national currencies, I am interested in competition for bitcoin in terms of 
other online currencies and what impact you think that might have on the future of bitcoin. Obviously, we have a 
limited money supply from individual countries. But what is to say that a number of competitors are not going to 
come into the bitcoin space and devalue the currency? I understand there are a number of other types of bitcoins 
already in the market. Is that an issue? 

Ms  Boring:    We  have  what  are  called  altcoins,  and  there  are  several  hundred  of  those.  Bitcoin  does  have  a 
first-mover  advantage  over  those  other  cryptocurrencies.  I  hate  using  the  word  'crypto',  but  that  is  what  these 
altcoins are. There are also noncryptocurrencies, digital  currencies, that are out there that have been around for 
several  decades.  But  bitcoin  made  a  revolutionary  leap  in  digital  currency  technology  because  it  is  a  digital 
currency  but  it  is  also  a  payment  system,  so  it  offers  different  types  of  technologies  from  what  other  digital 
currencies do. Among the altcoins, bitcoin has a huge first-mover advantage. Over 90 per cent of the market share 
of these cryptocurrencies are bitcoin. I guess any coin could eventually be the winner in the long run.

Gavin  Andresen,  who  is  the  core  developer  at  the  Bitcoin  Foundation,  said  that,  in  the  earliest  days  of  the 
internet, people would call the internet a decentralised node of communication. Today it is funny to even think of 
the  internet  like  that,  because  people  did  not  know  if  the  internet  was  going  to  be  that  new  means  of 
communication that won all. It is possible that other digital currencies could become the front runner, but right 
now it seems that everything is going into bitcoin. But the rules and regulations that affect bitcoin affect all digital 
currencies,  whether  they  are  crypto  or  non-crypto.  So  it  is  important  that  we  get  the  regulation  and  the  public 
policy right, because they can affect all these types of technology. It will also affect the existing financial system, 
the existing payment processors and money transmitters. 

CHAIR:    Okay.  We  are  actually  running  a  little  bit  behind,  so  with  the  consent  of the  committee  we  might 
pause it there. But, Ms Boring, I understand you are going to be participating in the panel discussion a little bit 
laterâ€”is that something you are available to participate in? 

Ms Boring:  Yes, sure. One more quick comment, because it is important: when it comes to bitcoin competing 
with national currencies like the US dollar, I think that is a foolish argument to make and I do not think anybody 
with  credibility  that  we  are  working  with  here  in  the  US  is  making  that  type  of  argument.  Nobody  is  trying  to 
overthrow the government's financial system. This is just about innovation and technology and strengthening the 
existing payments system. Nobody is trying to replace government-issued currencies. 

CHAIR:  Okay. Thank you. 

Ms Boring:  You are welcome.

CHAIR:    I welcome Mr Ron Tucker, from the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association. Do you 

have any comments on the capacity in which you appear? 

Mr Tucker:  I am also the appointed delegate of one of the association's members, Bit Trade Australia, which 

is the country's longest-running fixed bitcoin exchange. 

CHAIR:  How long has it been running? 

Mr Tucker:  For 18 monthsâ€”100 years in bitcoin years! 

CHAIR:  Before I invite you to make some opening remarks I want to acknowledge the fact that a lot of the 
proceedings  that  are  underway  have  actually  come  from  the  initiative  you  and  the  Australian  Digital  Currency 
Commerce Association have taken to try to front-foot and engage in the political process. I commend you on that. 
Would you like to make an opening statement? 

Mr Tucker:  In turn I would like to thank the committee for allowing Australia the opportunity to step forward 
and  allow  these  emerging  businesses  to  bring  this  issue  out  into  the  open.  It  is  something  that  does  need  to  be 
discussed, and there are a lot of questions that need to be answered, and there are a lot of challenges with it. It is 
very bigâ€”it is internet big. We know what the internet did to communication 20 to 25 years ago with email. We 
know what the internet did to publishing, music and film et cetera. 

The Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association was founded in April of this year to act as a unified 
voice for the Australian businesses operating in this sector. What promoted this move was the proposed ruling by 
the Australian Taxation Office to tax bitcoin like a commodity, a move that we thought did not make senseâ€”and 
that  was  the  general  consensus  of  most  stakeholders  invited  into  the  room  that  day,  barring  the  ATO's 
representatives. We felt that it was not applicable and that it could result in driving the digital currency businesses 
that were emerging in the sector offshore, and potentially underground. 

That was a domino that we had tried to prevent from falling one way. It did go that way. Again, we thank you 
for giving us the chance to address this. Fortunately, the ATO was the only area where the domino has fallen that 
way.  Through  the  efforts,  I  believe,  of  ADCCA  and  the  bitcoin  community  in  meeting  with  politicians  and 
regulators and briefing themâ€”a bit of a bitcoin 101 over the last several monthsâ€”the response from departments 
and regulators has been such that they have taken a bit more of a 'let's stand back and wait and see' attitude, and 
'let's be more informed'. This has been very beneficial. The blessing in disguise there has been that in that sense 
we have not ended up with a lot of confusion and a lot of mess, as we have heard, unfortunately, from our friends 
in the US, with their 53 money regulators and 10 departments that have already made decisions that have caused 
quite a bit of confusion. We have a pretty clear landscape here. In fact, though the tax ruling has essentially sent 
bitcoin businesses offshore already, and caused some Australian bitcoin businesses to close down completely, it 
has  also  invited  the  interest  of  other  international  digital  currency  businesses  to  pay  attention  to  Australia  as  a 
potential place to do business, not unlike perhaps Hong Kong is as a tax haven, or Ireland, where we see the tech 
giants Facebook and Google operate out of. We are already being identified early on as a potential place to bring 
this emerging digital currency business. 

Since  the  founding  of  ADCCA  we  have  made  great  strides  in  raising  awareness  amongst  government 
regulators and legislators on the issues we face as an industry. We have met with numerous politicians and heads 
of  government  departments  and  agencies,  as  well  as  some  of  our  counterparts  abroad,  and  even  delegates  and 
representatives from the G20. We have also held the world's first digital currency summit, which took place in 
Brisbane during the G20. We are already planning a follow-up conference in San Francisco next year, to be called 
the  Digital  Currency  San  Francisco  Summit.  This  is  where  we  are  proposing  the  formation  of  an  international 
association called the GDCC, the Global Digital Currency Congress, where we are speaking with our counterparts 
abroad  through  all  key  stakeholder  representativesâ€”the  finance  sector,  through  the  tech  sector  and  through 
governments. There is a great deal of interest in this. This is aiming to take place at the end of August 2015. With 
the  formation  of  the  GDCC  we  are  hoping  to  establish  this  formal  body  in  time  for  the  next  G20,  in  Istanbul, 
Turkey. 

Despite the newness of bitcoin and other digital currencies, my business was founded in only April 2013, 18 
months  ago.  It  is  one  of  the  oldest  in  the  country.  We  are  already  seeing  it  affect  finance  and  technology  in 
Australia.

We have seen what the internet has done to mail, music, film and retail and it is now happening to moneyâ€”it is 
happening a lot quicker too. With such change, however, comes riskâ€”risk so that we put in place a regulatory 
regime which stifles innovation and growth. We recently heard CIO of the RBA Sarv Girn highlight in a speech 
that, yes, there are considerations, there are risks and there are questions that need to be answered around digital 
currencyâ€”we need to get the right framework in place. But the greatest risk of all is by not acting quickly early 
enough and being left behind. We have seen this: we can easily look at other examples that have been affected by 
digital disruption over the last 15 years. 

If you have a look at the likes of Kodak, for exampleâ€”the biggest film company in the world. They failed to 
capitalise on the emergence of digital camera technology; or mobile phone technologyâ€”a company called Nokia 
in  1998  to  2000  started  putting  cameras  into  their  mobile  phones  and  it  quickly  became  the  biggest  camera 
provider in the world. What happened to Nokia? We have seen the Apple iPhone come along and usurp it. 

Again, my point is: it is so important early on to be aware of this and to react with some level of agility and to 
build that in early, have these conversations and be prepared to make some front-footed steps today. I say this not 
just out of self-interest of course but also because I believe Australia is better placed than any other country in the 
world to take advantage of this technology and the opportunities that are in front of us. 

Australia already has a world-leading financial services framework. Our banks punch well above their weight 
globally.  Compared  to  places  like  the  US,  the  regulatory  measures  needed  here  are  relatively  simple  to 
implement. We do not have 53 money regulators; we have just a handful to deal with. 

ADCCA  is proposing  a  self-regulatory  model  whereby  Bitcoin-centric  businesses  would  submit  to  a  code  of 
conduct,  if  they  join  our  organisation.  I  am  happy  to  elaborate  on  these  conduct  requirements  further  during 
questioning, but they are benchmarked against best-practice financial services frameworks and organisations that 
are already in place and proven. 

ADCCA will do most of the work to ensure we have a safe and dependable digital currency industry; however, 
we do need some small legislative changes to ensure that we get the best outcome. The first, as Andrew Sommer 
has  detailed,  is  a  change  in  the  tax  act  to  Bitcoin  to  tax  it  in  a  way  which  encourages  its  greatest  area  of 
commercial potentialâ€”that of being a medium of exchange. The second is to bring our sector within the financial 
reporting  tent  so  we  can  fully  comply  with  regulations  related  to  AUSTRAC  and  the  Attorney-General's 
Department. One thing we can do at the moment is have access to the Document Verification Service. 

With these simple and agile measures, I am confident Australia can become a regional, if not global, leader in 

the digital currency commerce space. I welcome any questions. 

CHAIR:  It is a quarter past 11, and we want to get the panel discussion underway right on 11.30, so we only 
have a few minutes for questions; however, we can give you more opportunity during the panel discussion. We 
are calling some people internationally for that and we do not want to delay them. We will have to be quite firm 
about stopping from 11.20 to 11.30; however, prior to thatâ€”

Mr Tucker:  I have done my time in the US as well. 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    Last  year,  according  to  the  World  Bank,  about  a  trillion  dollars  was  involved  in 
bribes. The cost of corruption was five per cent of GDPâ€”$5 trillion or thereabouts. The shadow banking market 
was 1Â¼ times global GDP, which is $125 trillion, and derivative turnover was $700 trillion. The amount of money 
involved  in  tax  avoidance  was  about  $3  trillion.  I  say  that,  if  we  cannot  fix  this,  we  are  going  to  redefine 
sovereignty. Are you talking about the redefinition of sovereignty? 

Mr Tucker:  What we are talking about is the potential for this technology to be able to eliminate fraud and 
tax  avoidance.  It  is  by  its  very  nature  built  into  the  thing  and,  if  we  act  quickly  now,  we  will  be  able  to  save 
ourselves trillions as well as make ourselves just as much in the future. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  As you would be aware, Canada has the world's safest banking system and the US is 
technically insolvent. Can you explain to me how this does not actually make the global community borderless, 
because it is a borderless currency?

Mr Tucker:  It is: it is the world's first truly global currency. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    You  are  proposing  that  you  want  to  be  defined  under  the  tax  act  so  therefore,  by 
definition,  transactions  that  occur  with  digital  currencies  or  bitcoins  will  be  liable  to  pay  income  tax  or 
whateverâ€” 

Mr Tucker:  Absolutely, unlike some of these people to whichâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  If you could define where the tax was due. 

Mr Tucker:  Yes. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  But how do you do that? How do you find the home?  

Senator CANAVAN:  That is a good question. Do you see thereâ€” 

Senator DASTYARI:  Why do we not put that question to Mr Sommer. He is a tax expert. 

Senator CANAVAN:  That is fine by me. 

Senator DASTYARI:  Mr Sommer, can you explain the international tax implications?  

Mr Sommer:  Bitcoin fits within the existing frameworks of residence and source for the allocation of taxation 
on income. For the purposes of GST and VAT, it falls within the place at which consumption occurs. It all falls 
within the existing taxation framework. 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    But  at  what  value?  I  have  been  critical  of  the  free  trade  agreement  with  China 
because  they  will  not  actually  put  their  currency  on  the  market.  How  do  you  determine,  in  currency  terms,  the 
value  of  bitcoin  if  it  is  sort  of  shadow  banking?  What  is  the  debt  worth?  In  China,  where  there  is  no  market 
attachment to the currency, and in the US, which is technically insolventâ€”it has borrowed US$5 trillion from its 
own pension fundâ€”how do you put a value on it to get a tax value of the debt? That is like China trying to argue 
that no-one in the world should have a market currency. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Is it not very different from China, though? China has a fixed currency regime. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  It is different. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    I  am  sorryâ€”I  just  want  to  clarify  this  for  the  witness.  The  digital  currencies  and 
certainly bitcoin, which we have spoken about most this morning, on the other hand, are market traded. There is a 
market  value.  It  is  that  market  value  that  the  ATO  would  use  to  determine  CGT  events  and  any  other  taxation 
liabilities. Is that right? 

Mr  Sommer:    Yes,  it  would  be  the  market  value  at  the  time  of  the  relevant  transaction.  In  relation  to  the 
valuation of loan booksâ€”that is not something I had not really focused on. But on a transactional basis, there is a 
point  at  which  the  transaction  occurs. That  transaction,  for  Australian  taxation  purposes,  needs  to  be  converted 
intoâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  From what I am hearing today, the more credence this gets, the more likely we are to 
have  a  redefinition  of  sovereigntyâ€”for  the  purposes  of  revenue  leakage.  The  market  value  can  vary  from  one 
waking morning to the next, depending on what is happening in the market. That in turn will absolutely, without 
any appreciation of sovereignty, alter your tax billâ€”if it is in bitcoin. 

Mr Tucker:  I take your point. 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    Do  not  respond  too quickly.  I  have  got  my  head  around  it;  you  need  to  get  yours 

around it. 

Senator EDWARDS:  I think he can answer. He is pretty smart.  

Mr Tucker:  My suggestion would be that a big part of this conversation is about who is doing the defining. If 
sovereignty is going to be redefined, what we are pushing for here today is to ensure that Australian has its hands 
on the reinsâ€”as it is well-equipped for. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  I am only a visitor 

Mr Tucker:  If we take a step back, obviously this is very much an international issueâ€”and it is only going to 

become more of one. But we still have to start domestically with what is in front of us. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Can you do us a quick tutorial on the derivatives swap marketâ€”the $700 trillion of 

turnover?  

Senator CANAVAN:  Chair, can I just sayâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  You need to be able to linkâ€”you probably cannot eitherâ€”this to that problem.

Mr Tucker:    Yes, and I can provide you with those answers, but they will not come directly  from me; they 
will come from the community I represent. That is why the Q&A panel session that is coming up is going to be 
answering these questions not just domesticallyâ€” 

Senator DASTYARI:  While we are on that note, because we need to have a quick break, I think there is a full 
Q&A panel at 11:30. I believe eight or nine people are going to be participating in that. That should be able to 
address some of the broader issues. I would love it if Senator Heffernan were able to stay around for that. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What percentage of the industry do you think you represent at the moment, Mr Tucker? 

I know that would be a difficult calculation to make. 

Mr Tucker:  It is difficult. That is a question we are actually looking into now. What I can tell you is that there 
are four founding members and we probably have about five dozen EOIs on the book. We were not prepared to 
open up membership and start ingesting members until we had a solid constitution worked out and some of these 
conversations had been had. 

Senator CANAVAN:  That has not happened yet?  

Mr Tucker:  It is due to open up in January. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  The global agreement on taxation has not caught up with this. That is the big issue: 

the definition of sovereignty.

Evidence from Ms Boring, Mr Cullen, Mr Shapiro and Mr Zhou was taken via teleconferenceâ€”  

CHAIR:    I  welcome  back  this  morning's  witnesses  and  some  new  witnesses.  This  session  will  be  a  panel 
discussion.  Mr  Pesce,  Mr  Cullen,  Mr  Sommer,  Mr  Guzowski  and  Mr  Tucker  have  already  participated  in  the 
hearing  today,  as  has  Ms  Boring  from  the  US.  Our  new  witnesses  are  Mr  Zhou  and  Mr  Shapiro.  Starting  with 
those at the table, I will get each of you to tell us a little about why you are here. 

Mr Guzowski:  I am CEO and founder of ABA Technology, which operates bitcoin ATMs around Australia 

and is developing software applications for consumers and merchants to be able to use bitcoin more easily. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Perhaps we can get each witness to give their corporate entity and the ABN attached 

to the corporate entityâ€”perhaps on notice? 

CHAIR:  We can do all that on notice. I think it would be an unfair request to put to them now. 

Mr Pesce:  I am here in a private capacity. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  What do you do? Are you a banker, a drug runner? What are you? 

Mr Pesce:  I am neither. I have been an entrepreneur, inventor and technology analyst for 30 years. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  What is your background? We need to know who you are, where you come from and 

so on. 

Mr Pesce:  My background in the sense of technology? 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Where do you live, for a start? 

Mr Pesce:  Sydney. I am an Australian citizen. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Can we have some sort of identification? 

CHAIR:  He is a futurist. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Yes, but I like to have who people are in written form. You could say you  are Joe

Mr Pesce:  You could probably look me up on Wikipedia. 

CHAIR:  We actually already have bios of everyone who is participating today. I will happily provide them to 

you, Senator Heffernan. 

Mr Tucker:  I am the chairman of the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association. We are the peak 
industry body representing the interests of emerging bitcoin businesses as well as all cross-industry stakeholders. 
Additionally, I am the delegated representative of one of ADCCA's members, Bit Trade Australia, a fixed bitcoin

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Are you here representing the representative body or Bitcoin? 

Mr  Tucker:    I  am  the  representative  of  ADCCA.  I  am  here  in  that  capacity.  However,  as  a  matter  of

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Where are you now. 

Mr Zhou:  I am currently in the US. I am actually on holiday so I cannot see what is going on over there. I am

Mr  Shapiro:    I  am  a  director  of  Promontory  Financial  Group.  Despite  my  accent,  I  am  based  out  of  San 
Francisco.  We  are  a  regulatory  risk  management  and  compliance  consultancy.  I  lead  our  work  on  digital 
currencies as well as emerging payments more generally. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Could we have your tax identify and IRS information from the US? 

CHAIR:  We will take all this stuff on notice. 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    I  would  like  them  to  take  it  on  notice  to  provide  their  background.  There  is  a 
purpose. The largest Inland Revenue taxation caseâ€”of tax avoidanceâ€”in the US last year involved an Australian 
company. 

CHAIR:    This  is  a  little  bit  of  a  new  approach  for  us.  I  want  to  have,  as  much  as  we  can,  a  free-flowing 
discussion. That means people should take the opportunity to  jump in, ask questions, participate and have their 
say.  If  the  panel  or  those  on  the  phone  have  something  to  add,  please  jump  in.  I  will  get  us  started  with  the 
fundamental, basic question: to what extent hasâ€”what Mr Sommer  touched on, which seems to be the catalyst 
issueâ€”the taxation issue and how the ATO has decided to deal with it had an impact on the potential growth of 
the industry? I want to start with you, Mr Tucker. 

Mr  Tucker:    Certainly.  We  have  seen  the  closure  of  some  Australian  Bitcoin  businesses.  Living  Room  of 
Satoshi was one of the first ones to go down. We have seen other businesses move, or plan to move, offshore and 
taking potential tax revenues and other revenues away from Australia. The proposed tax guidance that has been 
taken  up  here  in  Australia  is  not  in  line  with  international  trends.  That  is  one  thing.  Secondly,  it  also  sends  a 
message that this is something to question, which perhaps drives it more underground rather than out into the light 
where, from a tax point of view, we could be perhaps reaping the rewards from this. 

CHAIR:  Okay. Mr Pesce? 

Mr Pesce:  The big problem here is that treating it as a commodity effectively makes it very difficult to treat it 
as  a  currency.  You have  to have  one  or  the other. You cannot  have  half  the nations  in  the  world  deciding  it  is 
going to be a currency and the other half deciding it is going to be a commodity. It just is not going to work. It is 
going  to  jam  everything  up.  If  you  are  using  a  digital  currency,  whether  that  is  bitcoin  or  something  else,  it  is 
probably going to lead to an all-in scenarioâ€”all the parties have to treat it as one thing or the other. 

CHAIR:  I would not mind getting the perspectives of Perianne and others from the US on this. It seems like 
there is a split across the world in how it is being dealt with. Those economies that have decided to treat it as a 
currency have created an opportunity for themselves in a business sense, and those that have chosen to treat it as a 
commodityâ€”especially  those  that  have  things  like  sales  tax,  like  we  have  hereâ€”effectively  have  driven  that 
business offshore. I would like to speak to our friends over in the US. Have the Americans treated it as a currency 
or a commodity? 

Mr  Shapiro:    The  answer  is:  somewhat  both.  It  depends  which  US  authority  you  are  looking  at.  The 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission have indicated that they believe it is a commodity, the Internal Revenue 
Service have indicated they believe it is property, and the money-laundering regulator that Perianne was talking

about earlier has indicated that it is money but not currency. The SEC have said that they believe that, under the 
securities law, it is currency. There is a somewhat confused position here. 

Perhaps  another  way  of  looking  at  it  that  might  be  helpful  isâ€”although  this  creates  some  confusionâ€”the 
position  of  the  taxation  authorities  here,  which  is  to  subject  it  to  capital  gains  tax  as  the  main  tax.  From  an 
economic perspective, that seems to me to be a relatively logical outcome. If someone was fortunate enough to 
buy  bitcoin  when  it  was  valued  at  only  a  few  cents  and  now  sells  it,  the  capital  gains  tax  seems  to  be  an 
appropriate way to treat that for taxation purposes. 

It is, as many of the witnesses said earlier, very hard to build a retail business if you have to put a value-added 
tax on top. It does seem to me, regardless of the treatment under the tax lawâ€”which I am not an expert onâ€”to be 
something that is predictably going to hinder growth. That is why you see that some countries like the UK, which 
initially took that approach, have found a way to reverse it. 

CHAIR:    You  have  already  explained  the  American  context  and  we  have  had  a  fair  discussion  about  the 

Australia context. Are you in a position to explain the British context? 

Mr Shapiro:   I can, a little. I should probably explain that, before I joined Promontory, I worked at the UK 
Financial Services Authority for about eight years. While I am not as expert, I have kept up contacts there and am 
in frequent contact with my London office and some of the companies in the UK space. You are welcome to ask 
me questions, and I will tell you if you are getting out of my knowledge base. 

CHAIR:  I would like you to give us a little run-down, anyway. In the Australian context, they made it fairly 
clear  that  they  made  a  decision  that  the  tax  regime  in  Australia  is  not  able  to  deal  with  this.  The  view  of  the 
Australian Taxation Office is:  'We are not passing judgement, but the framework we have been given does not 
allow us to treat this as currency, so we are treating it as a commodity.' You are saying that the American context 
seems to be a little bit more complicatedâ€”that it is an agency by agency approach. It seems a bit more muddled.  

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Which is bullshit. 

CHAIR:  A technical term!  

Mr  Shapiro:    It  is  somewhat  more  muddled,  although,  to  be  fair  to  the  agencies,  they  are  all  interpreting 
different  laws.  I  would  much  rather  see  agencies  try  to  come  to  a  common-sense  approach  under  the  law  that 
applies  to  them  than  worry  about  whether  all  the  agencies  have  the  same  definition.  I  do  not  think  that  the US 
authorities have been doing a bad job on that. In the light of what these agencies look at, a lot of these definitions 
are  quite  sensible.  In  the  UK  context,  it  is  notable  that  the  UK  is  somewhat  constrained  by  European  Union 
legislation as well. The European Banking Authority, the umbrella authority that covers payment services and e-
money, did publish a paper in July that says that they do not believe that virtual currency is subject to regulation 
at the moment. It called on the European Commission to make digital currency companies obliged entities for the 
purposes of the EU anti-money-laundering laws.  

What  I  do  see  in  the  UK  is  an  approach  where  all  the  relevant  authoritiesâ€”the  Treasury,  Her  Majesty's 
Revenue  and  Customs,  the  prudential  regulatory  authority,  the  Bank  of  England  and  the  Financial  Conduct 
Authorityâ€”have  taken  sensible  positions.  They  are  trying  to  educate  themselves  and  are  not  trying  to  take 
precipitous action. In some cases they may have made a judgement that made little sense in terms of development 
of the industry, such as the initial decision they subsequently reversed on VAT. I think they have done a very nice 
job of listening to concerns and seeing what they can do. Of course I make no comment on Australian law. It may 
be the UK authoritiesâ€” 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    To  put  all  that  into  about  two  sentencesâ€”because  it  is  a  sort  of  bureaucratic 
presentationâ€”in  the  UK,  are  you  in  no-man's  land?  What  you  have  said  in  the  last  five  minutes  sounds  like  a 
lawyer's feast. Can you put that in two sentencesâ€”where you are? 

Mr  Shapiro:    In  the  UK,  there  is  tax  and  there  are  capital  gains.  The  regulators  at  the  moment  are  not 
regulating it, although they are watching it closely. Part of that is driven by EU legislation. I do have some clients 
who think that is a great position. I also have some clients who think that being regulated is an important sign of 
legitimacy and would much rather be regulated in the EU than not. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  I will just get you to pause there. 

Mr Shapiro:  It is a mixed bag. It depends on your perspective. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Are you saying it is really in no-man's land at the moment? 

Mr Tucker:  If I may interjectâ€”

Mr Shapiro:  It is somewhat in no-man's land. Some people think that is really good for the development of 
the industry. It gives it flexibility. Some people think there needs to be a clearer long-term framework before you 
see mass adoption. 

CHAIR:  Mr Tucker, what brings us here today is that there is a key questionâ€”and it is a legitimate question. 
There are naturally going to be concernsâ€”and there are concerns. There are concerns at a taxation level, at the 
money-laundering level, at a crime and misconduct level, and at a stability of banking level. The real challengeâ€”
and I would like Mr Tucker's and Mr Pesce's opinions on thisâ€”is the best way of addressing these concerns in the 
Australian  context,  and  that  means    having  an  appropriate  framework  around  it.  It  sounds,  from  what  you  are 
saying, Mr Shapiro, as if around the world there remains a lack of clarity or a single path forward. The challenge 
for us is whether we take that opportunity or not. What do you think, Mr Tucker? 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Could I just add to that too? If that is the case and it is in no-man's-landâ€”we have 
heard the US version of itâ€”won't the cluster just go to the most economically convenient headquarters? If it is 
taxable here, won't they just say, 'We'll just slip it in through wherever'? 

Mr  Tucker:    That  is  a  very  good  question.  I  think  that  is  also  still  being  decided,  and  I  guess  one  of  the 
initiatives of ADCCA is to ensure that the favourable place for that to be is ultimately Australia, because we are 
the ones who want to reap the economic benefits that are due to comeâ€” 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    With  great  respect,  there  was  $3  trillion  of  tax  avoidance  last  year,  mainly  in  the 
derivatives and transfer pricing markets. Australia is a victim of it, but we cannot solve it. Australia can have a 
position  on  this  which  could  be  to  Australia's  own  detriment  if  it  is  not  a  unilateral  thing.  It  has  to  be  an 
international agreement. You guys should go away and come back when you have global compliance on whether 
it is a commodity, whether it is finance and how you determine the value. When you have done that, come back 
and see us. 

Mr  Pesce:    To  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  the  New  York  state  regulator  is  taking  the  lead  on  this  and  is 
currently drafting something known as the BitLicence, which you can actually review in its interim format now. 
That is going to be the first piece of legislationâ€”because most of the banks are headquartered in New Yorkâ€”that 
will set the tone for what global regulation either should be, if they do it correctly, or what it should not be, if it is 
done poorly. They are taking a lot of advice during this process. It is going to be a few more months before it is 
done,  but  that  BitLicence  is  probably  going  to  be  the  very  first  flag  on  that  mountain  that  will  help  guide  the 
wholeâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Will this determine whether it is a currency or a commodity? 

Mr Pesce:  It will determine how the financial institutions regulated by the state of New Yorkâ€”and they are 
done  on  a  state-by-state  basis  in  Americaâ€”will  work  with  digital  currencies.  That  will  then  set  the  tone  for  at 
least the rest of the United States and then probably internationally.  

Senator CANAVAN:  Would there be any major business in the world that uses bitcoins or digital currencies? 

Mr Tucker:  Dell computers, Expedia.com, eBay, PayPal and Facebook are all making moves. IBM has just 

announced theirâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  They are fantastic tax avoiders, all of those. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So are they using bitcoins for the majority of their transactions? 

Mr Tucker:  No, it is a small proportion. 

Senator CANAVAN:  They are offering people the ability to pay in bitcoins? 

Mr Tucker:  This is correct, yes. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Do you have any idea what percentage of their revenue would be in bitcoins? 

Mr Tucker:  No, not at this time. We can follow up. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Presumably it would be very small at this stage, by definition. 

Mr Tucker:  It would be very small at this stage. 

Mr Guzowski:  Overstock.com released a statement that they were facilitating enough revenue for it to have 
contributed to a number of cents per share in earnings. Overstock, which is a large online retailer in the US, has 
clearly  identified  how  much  volume  there  is,  and  it  is  making  significant  profit  to  shareholders  from  revenue 
generated through bitcoin payments. 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:   Can I just go to something  you can touch and feel. In relation to those companies 
who  are  well-established  multinationals,  very  successful  and  very  good  tax  avoiders  without  breaking  the  law, 
don't they need to decide whether they are trading in terms you can touch and feel? You can have in-kind trading,

which is a bag of wheat for a bag of oats or a bag of corn, as a commodity. Are they determined to trade as a 
currency  or  a  commodity  and  is  it  in-kind  value? How  do  they  determine  the  commodity  value,  other  than  the 
rush of the market, which is all about how many spruikers you have in the market? Are Google, or whoever it is, 
trading a commodity? In other words, I owe you $10 and here is $10 worth of wheat. 

Mr Tucker:  They are accepting bitcoin as a currency. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  If they go to a regime where it is accepted as a commodity, how does one link with 

the other? Has Clayton Utz thought about that? 

Mr Zhou:  Let's just take a step back and pretend that we are back in 1999, when the internet was first coming 
out and a lot of the different regulatory bodies were trying to figure out how to classify it. What exactly is the 
internet?  Is  it  more  similar  to  a  telephone,  is  it  more  similar  to  software,  or  is  it  more  similar  to  electricity 
utilities? 

The internet itself, when it came about, was so unique in its own right that it became very hard to classify, other 
than as itself. 

Bitcoin has a lot of similar properties. In some ways it is like a commodity; in some ways it is like a currency. 
In some ways, if  you really think about it, physically what it actually  is is a configuration of bits on  your hard 
disk. So it really is just data and information at its most basic physical level. Ultimately, on how to classify the 
internet, I think they decided that it was most similar to telecommunications but maybe still a little bit different. I 
think the best way to classify bitcoin, if you had to put it into one of the categories that we currently understand, 
would be to look at how people actually use it. I think the vast majority of people use it a lot more like a currency 
than as anything else. So, based on how people use it, I would say that bitcoin is a currency. That is my opinion, 
but obviously here in the States different regulatory bodies have different thoughts on how to classify it. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  But wouldn't the revenue body of the United States, the Treasury, have to have made 

a decision on how to treat the trade that you are saying is going on now for tax purposes? 

Senator CANAVAN:  We had a discussion on that earlier. 

CHAIR:  We have covered that. 

Senator CANAVAN:  There is a US representative still on the lineâ€”is that right? 

CHAIR:  Yes, Ms Boring. 

Senator CANAVAN:    My  understandingâ€”correct me if  I am wrong, Ms Boringâ€”was that  you said earlier 
that the IRS has defined digital currencies as property at this stage for tax purposes. So they are treated like the 
barter situation you mentioned before. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  But we have just been told that they are treating it as a currency. 

CHAIR:  No. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  One does not fit with the other. 

Senator CANAVAN:  No, that is how an individual company would like to treat it for taxation purposes in the 

United States, as it is here in Australia at this stage. 

CHAIR:  Senator Heffernan, you have come in quite late in a discussion we have had quite extensive coverage 

of. We spent about four hours covering this. 

Mr Zhou:  I think the IRS deems it as more of a commodity, but FINRA and FinCEN, the regulatory bodies 
responsible for money transmission, favour it more as a currency. They do not call it a currency, but they want to 
treat  it  more  like  a  currency  than  a  commodity.  I  think  there  is  a  bit  of  a  conflict  of  interest  here,  because  the 
different regulatory bodiesâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  You can say that again. 

Mr Zhou:  are having a duel to regulate it and have a little bit more sway in how things play out. I think the 
different bodies are fighting for control over this nascent space as bitcoin is growing. The IRS obviously wants to 
make it a commodity because it makes it much more easily taxable. If you treat it like a currency, the IRS would 
have no hold on taxing bitcoin. So for them it makes a lot of sense to classify it as a commodity, and it makes 
sense for FINRA and FinCEN to classify it more like a currency. 

CHAIR:  I want to bring the discussion back to the premise of why we are here. Let's just get some things on 
the table that we have already covered so that we do not cover them again. Firstly, we had Ms Boring and others 
give us evidence this morning that there is an inevitability about where we are heading with digital currency. That 
was  the  evidence  of  Mr  Pesce  and  Ms  Boring  from  the  USâ€”that  there  is  an  inevitability  about  where  we  are 
heading with digital currency because of the nature of the internet and the nature of the movement of money.

Secondly, we have been given a fair bit of evidence that bitcoin is probably the leading, most likely candidate 
to be the expression of that. The fact that there is $6 billion worth  of trade means that it has probably passed a 
threshold that others have not yet. If there is going to be a digital currency to emerge, it is quite likely that it is 
going to be bitcoin. I do not think we need to cover that ground again. 

Thirdly, while I do not want to get sidetracked in a debate about international tax avoidance, the question here 
is: what is the best way for us in the Australian context to set laws and regulations to allow us to maximise the 
potential opportunities that bitcoin presents as a future industry and a future business and, at the same time, not 
expose ourselves in a regulatory sense to potential downfalls from a government level or place controls that stifle 
the growth of the industry here? 

I  would  like  to  get  back  to  first  principles  and  bring  the  discussion  back  to  that.  Where  is  the  potential?  Mr 
Guzowski,  I  cut  you  off  earlier  when  you  were  making  your  presentation.  Talk  about  the  innovation  and  the 
opportunities in the Australian context, if there is a framework here that allows the businesses to grow. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Add to that: how can you do that if you have not got global harmonisation? 

CHAIR:  But we are not going to solve the harmonisation issue. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  If you do not, you will end up like Peter Costello having to explain why the Future 

Fund has 14 companies in tax havens. 

CHAIR:    I believe the world will be following our Senate inquiry and whatever we decide will become  the 

global standard! 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  And I believe 99Â½ per cent of the people would not understand and could not give a 

derivative swap tutorial. 

Mr  Guzowski:    Bitcoin  is  a  software  protocol  and  open  source  and  therefore  available  to  anybody  who  is 
inclined and technically knowledgeable to write code and facilitate applications utilising the Bitcoin protocol and 
allowing  the  transfer  of  digital  property  across  the  internet  from  one  user  to  another.  That  has  a  huge  host  of 
applications, a lot of which we have not identified yet just as the internet 20 years ago was an unknown quantity. 
Twenty years ago Telstra, the government owned telco, started as a business facilitating Australian consumers to 
start purchasing modems and connecting to this World Wide Web. Do not quote me on the year that happened, 
because I was only born in 1984; however, I do remember as a teenager being able to connect through a dial-up 
modem to the internet and access this World Wide Web of information. 

All  of  a  sudden  we  have  this  technology  which  is  very  similar  in  susceptibility  to  the  network  effect,  the 
network effect being the more users there are of this technology, the more useful it becomes to other users. The 
more  merchants  accept  bitcoin,  the  more  consumers  are  likely  to  use  it.  The  more  consumers  use  it,  the  more 
merchants  will  want  to  accept  it.  The  more  miners  facilitating  the  reconciliation  process,  the  more  secure  it 
becomes.  The  fourth  layer  of  this  four  sided  network  effect  is  the  application  developers  who  are  creating 
applicationsâ€”programsâ€”which make this technology more useful. This is a financial technology and therefore a 
little bit more sensitive than others. That is why we are having this discussion today before the real take-off of this 
technology: because it is potentially sensitive and we want to get the rules right before it gets out of our control 
and our rules will be a slap. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Correctâ€”and we want to learn from the earlier technology. You said online buying. 
There  was  no  global  harmonisation.  Google  et  cetera  are  getting  away  with  no  tax.  Our  retailers  have  been 
smashed, and we do not have GST on online sales. The build-up in the market is almost vertical. We have to get 
this harmonised before we start to play the game. 

Mr Guzowski:  That is right; but, on the flip-side of that coin, Australian retailers are now very aggressively 

attacking offshore markets. We have great online stores, whether it is Koganâ€” 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    To  pause  there:  my  point  was  that,  if  you  want  to  have  public  schools  and  public 
hospitals, it has nothing to do with the profits of the retailer. Sydney Airport had its headquarters in a tax haven 
till 14 months ago. It is the common good that is important as much as the commercial good. We want to have 
public schools and public hospitalsâ€”even though Senator David Leyonhjelm does not, I do. 

CHAIR:  I think we are going back to what I was hoping to avoid, which was entering a discussion. Now we 

are discussing schools, hospitals and bitcoin. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  It is pertinent. 

Senator CANAVAN:  I want to ask Mr Sommer's views on these issuesâ€”sorry to return to them. I do share 
Senator Heffernan's views on the issues involved in international tax avoidance. I suppose that, presumably, all of 
that has happened in a non-bitcoin world. Is that your view?

Mr Sommer:  Yes, absolutely. If you look at the European Union's approach to this issue, you see they have 
the one framework for the operation of their VATs and yet there are different answers within the European Union 
as to the appropriate taxation of bitcoin and its characterisation. So I think that, in terms of harmonisation across 
the world, it is too difficult a process to adopt as to whether this should be taxed as a commodity or as a currency. 
The important thing for Australia is to ensure that the design of our tax system, both from an income tax and a 
GST perspective, gives us an appropriate share of the tax base but is also appropriate for what it is those things 
are  supposed  to  be  taxing.  Income  tax  can  tax  income  derivedâ€”the  same  principles  as  ever  before,  unless  we 
would  want  to  change  those  bases  of  source  and  residency  from  an  income  tax  perspective.  From  a  GST 
perspective, it is a far better tax for ensuring that Australia gets its share of the tax base, based on consumption in 
Australia irrespective of how you pay for it. That is the way that the tax system operates outside of bitcoin and 
with bitcoin. I am concerned particularly in relation to where we are with bitcoin at the moment. By taxing it as a 
commodity,  we  are  not  taxing  it  in  the  way  that  it  operates  and  it  is  inconsistent  with  the  functional  aspects  of 
bitcoin effectively as a means of exchange and a store of value. 

Senator  CANAVAN:    To  the  extent  that  bitcoin  or  digital  currencies  could  pose  a  threat  to  other  financial 
institutions  or  their  business  models,  the  current  tax  laws  protect  banks  and  other  financial  institutionsâ€”would 
that be the right way to put it? For example, Western Union makes a substantial amount of money on international 
transfers,  and  if  you  have  this  double-taxation  environment  here  in  Australia  on  bitcoins,  that  protects  Western 
Union's business modelâ€”is that right? 

Mr Sommer:  Yes. It protects those industry players that are dealing in existing fair currencies as opposed to 

virtual currencies or digital currencies. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Where are you at with the self-regulatory code that ADCCA wanted to put in place? I 
notice in your submission to the FSI inquiry you had some broad principlesâ€”when do you think the code will be 
complete? Is it in draft form at the moment? 

Mr Tucker:  There are some very good questions being asked here today and I think to know where we are 
going, we have to know where we have come from. We have taken a look back at what has come before in other 
industries that have faced similar circumstances. As it was told to me and from what I understand, a gentleman 
walked into the offices of Gilbert and Tobin some 20 to 25 years ago with an idea to send money electronically 
between banks. It did not get too far, it was called EFTPOS. It did not get too far early on, but they formed an 
association  called  the  Australian  Payments  Clearing  Association.  The  association  advocated,  essentially,  a  self-
regulatory model with healthy government oversight to  mock up a framework that would be appropriate to this 
new innovative technology. We have taken a look at their workâ€”we are very big fans. We think we have similar 
DNA, considering where we are placed today at these early stages.  

What we have developed essentially is a membership structure with a stringent set of best practices and a code 
of  ethics  and  conduct.  There  are  three  membership  types:  the  first  being  industry  member,  the  second  being 
associate  member  and  the  third  being  partner  member.  Industry  member  is  the  key  one  hereâ€”it  is  a  digital 
currency-centric  membership  type.  The  secondâ€”associate  memberâ€”is  aimed  at  merchants  who  are  accepting 
bitcoin  and  digital  currencies.  The  thirdâ€”partner  membersâ€”are  the  major  international  participants  and 
enterprise level industry members who may wish to join.  

The key here is industry member. They are also eligible for something called an ADCCA certification, which is 
benchmarked off an Australian Financial Services Licence. Firstly, for the AFSL, the ADCCA certification starts 
with the requirement for all directors to undergo background checks. That would include disqualified directorship 
checks,  bankruptcy  checks, national  police  checks  et  cetera.  Secondly,  the  ADCCA certification  requirement  is 
the need to implement a robust anti-money-laundering program by one of the approved providers. Thirdly, they 
then need to follow-up with an audit on this AML program and that would have to be undertaken every two years. 
Fourthly, they would have to acquire professional indemnity insurance, something of which we are speaking to 
some of the major international insurance providers about and are quite eager to see this happen. Fifthly, we are 
speaking with four services who are inclined to develop a financial services ombudsman structure or service that 
accommodates  these  emerging  DC  and  bitcoin  businesses.  Lastly,  and  this  is  key,  is  the  need  for  registered 
wallets. The great question around bitcoin and blockchain has not been on its ability to trace transactions from A 
to Z. It is, quite frankly, an auditor's dream on a transparent public ledger.  It is about who is actually use these 
bitcoins.  So  our  proposal  here  is  that  industry  members  who  become  ADCCA  certified  would  be  willing  to 
voluntarily raise  their hand and point out and say,  'This is  my  section of the blockchain. These are my  wallets. 
These  are  my  transactions,'  when  appropriate.  That  should  also  be  made  available  to  law  enforcement,  when 
appropriate. So this is the veryâ€”

Senator  CANAVAN:    Can  I  stop  you  there,  just  quickly?  When  you  say  their  wallets,  does  that  extend  to 

people, or is that just the businesses? 

Mr Tucker:  The businesses. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Say I have an account with an industry member of ADCCA. Would they be recording 
my  details  under  this  code  of  conduct  and  would  they  potentially  share  that  with  law  enforcement?  Is  that  the 
idea? 

Mr Tucker:  The ADCCA certification is intended for businesses to lay claim. As far as consumers go, in line 
with industry best practice in the established financial services sector, our members are also required to ask for 
100 points of ID. KYCâ€”know your customerâ€”you need to know who it is. So it would be consumers as well. 
This would be a requirement of the industry members. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So if you wanted to be a member of your organisation, you would have to comply with 

'know your customer'. 

Mr  Tucker:    This  is  absolutely  correct,  and  you  would  then  have  to  implement  an  ongoing  due  diligence 
program.  There  needs  to  be  a  robust  AML  program  in  place.  Many  of  our  members  already  do  this  and  are  in 
compliance with the AML regime up to as much as 90 or 95 per cent. It is that 5 per cent difference where we are 
literally unable to do so. For example, we are not able to register with the Document Verification Service. We are 
not required to report to AUSTRAC. Fortunately, we have been told that we can voluntarily supply information to 
AUSTRAC,  in  line  with  what  would  be  required  by  the  established  sector.  For  example,  there  are  three  main 
reports that are given by financial institutions, day in, day outâ€”IFTs, international funds transfers; TTRs, that is, 
transactions  above  $10,000;  and  SMRs,  suspicious  matter  reportsâ€”which  our  bitcoin  companies  fill  out  an 
equivalent to and keep on file or report to AUSTRAC voluntarily. 

Senator CANAVAN:  Does your company or some of the members do that every day, basically? Or is it that 

you monitor it every day, but you might not put a report in every day? 

Mr Tucker:  The reports are submitted as would be required. 

Senator CANAVAN:  So if you had a transaction over $10,000, you would report that to AUSTRAC at the 

moment. 

Mr Tucker:  Those are required to be submitted within three days. Each company has its own processes. So 
you would have to speak with each individual company as to how that works. At the meetings we have had with 
regulators and departments they have been quite surprised that we are coming to them saying, essentially, that we 
do want to be regulated. It is not that we want to be regulatedâ€”that comes at a great cost. It is a matter of people 
wanting to comply with best practice and do the right thingâ€”to walk on the sunny side of the street. That is also 
what we are asking for on the tax issue. That is the other major issue here. We are asking to be treated fairly and 
that  Australian  business  be  given  the  opportunity  to  thrive  and  to  take  hold  and  be  an  innovator  on  this  front. 
There  is  a  desperate  need  in  Australia,  moving  forward,  regionallyâ€”especially  as  this  community  globalises 
more, and so does the economyâ€”that we position ourselves as an innovator and be on the front foot here. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Would you say that AUSTRAC has not caught up with the technology? 

Mr  Tucker:    This  is  right.  For  example,  we  hosted  a  forum  in  Canberra  on  9  July  to  raise  awareness  for 
government departments and regulators. We had 21 representatives from 11 departments, from ACCC to PMO, 
RBA and Treasury. A lot of people came to the table to learn about bitcoin. We started the conversation by saying 
that  what  we  would  like  to  do  is  agree  to  a  common  glossary  of  terms.  You  hear  'virtual  currency',  'digital 
currency', 'cryptocurrency' et cetera. So we agreed to digital currency. Was it 'Bitcoin' or 'bitcoin'? And the reason 
we did this was to lay a foundation early on to avoid a situation where, in a set of legislation, the terminology for 
ASIC could mean something completely different to the Tax Office. In order to globalise this in the way in which 
we are discussing, it needs to be done. I think we first have to start at home here and get it right and get the terms 
rightâ€”you have got to wash your face before you put on your lipstickâ€”and that is where we are at. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  I am interested to hear from any members of the panel, including those who are 
here via teleconference, about where the momentum for the advocacy of bitcoin is coming from. I understand that 
Coinbase  and  BitPay  are  venture  capital  for-profit  organisations,  but  where  does  the  advocacy  come  from  to 
establish  the  legitimacy  of  bitcoin?  Is  it  decentralised,  like  the  whole  concept? Or  are  you  organised? How  are 
you going about promoting the use of bitcoin? 

Mr  Tucker:    Perianne  Boring  is  essentially  our  counterpart,  with  the  CDC  in  the  US.  We  have  seen 
counterpart associations emerge all over the world. In Japan they have the Japanese Authority on Digital Assets. 
There is the UK Digital Currency Association. South Africa has an association. There is something being formed

in  Ireland,  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge.  Singapore  has  something  called  ACCESS.  I  do  not  know  what  the 
acronym  actually  stands  for.  But  there  are  counterpart  associations  emerging  all  around  the  world.  We  are 
communicating with one another, and that is the point of hosting this summit in San Francisco mid next yearâ€”to 
bring these participants to the table, as well as representatives from industry, as well as informed and educated 
and  experienced  participation  from  regulatory  backgrounds,  professional  associations  and  government  or  ex-
government  where  appropriate  as  well,  to  have  a  conversation,  to  talk  about  what  an  international  framework 
could and should look like and what is in everybody's best interests. 

Mr Pesce:  There are two sides to this. There is the top-down side, which I think Ronald was representing, but 
there is also the bottom-up aspect, in that the basic innovations in bitcoin and block chain technology have solved 
so many problemsâ€” 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  But they are demand driven, essentially? 

Mr  Pesce:    Well,  you  are  seeing  a  lot  of  very  bright  engineers  and  entrepreneurs  get  brainwaves  and  build 

companies around the brainwaves they are having, so it is really working from both directions. 

Mr  Shapiro:    And  certainly  it  was  interesting  in  the  United  States,  with  the  New  York  Bit  License.  The 
Department of Financial Services heard from a lot of people in New York who are using bitcoin, not just from the 
big  companies  and  the  trade  associations.  I  think  that  grassroots  point  is  important.  But  I  think  there  is  an 
important  role  for  the  growing  number  of  venture-backed  companies  here.  There  are  big  risks  here,  as  people 
have been talking about, about anti-money-laundering sanctions and consumer wallet security. And a lot of that 
venture capital funding that you heard about earlier has come recently. I think 75 per cent of it has been invested 
in  the  last  nine  months,  and  that  is  letting  a  lot  of  the  companies  that  have  that  investment  make  much  greater 
strides, employ larger staffsâ€”in compliance, in engineeringâ€”to solve wallet security issues. And there is a really 
important role as well for those companies in showing that they can walk the talk as well as talk it, and solve the 
issues the industry needs to overcome. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  Just with my own community in Launceston, Tasmania, there is a big push to 
get  bitcoin  established  there,  including  maybe  an  exchange,  and  two  machines,  I  understandâ€”which  would  be 
one more than in New York, if that is correct. And I understand that there is a tech community down there, and 
there is a lot of innovation, and they are looking to do different things. But the people I have spoken to already 
obviously own bitcoin. They have all invested in bitcoin. I am just interested in whether you are formalising an 
advocacy role for bitcoin and in who is paying for that, because clearly you have a huge task ahead of you to get 
this as a well-established traded currency that is a medium of exchange as well as a store of value. Is it just sort of 
coming from innovation? Or are you getting more organised in terms of people who get in at a base level? Will 
they benefit from it long-term as an investment as well if they can help drive it? 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    What  he  is  really  asking  you,  politely,  is:  who  are  the  venture  capitalists  behind 
thisâ€”their details? I am a sheep farmer. I look after agricultural things here, and I always declare an interest. Do 
you have a declarable financial interest? 

Mr Tucker:  What I can say is that here in Australia we have identified five key stakeholders in Australia. The 
first level is the public peer-to-peer network, which drives bitcoin and the adoption of this phenomenon that we 
have seen move from an awareness by two out of 10 people 18 months ago to now nine or 9Â½ per cent who are at 
least  aware  of  bitcoin.  That  is  remarkable  in  itself.  So  that  is  No.  5,  the  base;  No.  4  is  the  small  and  medium 
enterprisesâ€”the  small  business  owners  who  are  identifying  the  opportunity  that  exists  within  this  and  have 
established businesses. No. 3, in the middle of the five, is the network, and the nervous system, if you will. It is 
the  professionals  and  the  professional  associationsâ€”the  lawyers,  the  accountants,  the  tax  agents  et  cetera.  The 
professionals and their associations also include folks like the AIST and APO and the retailers' association and a 
number  of  others,  many  of  whom  are  doing  regular  weekly  presentations  to  educate  them  on  bitcoin.  We  are 
being invited in across the country to show them what the risks and opportunities are here. This is also the army 
of professionals that service the SMEs below and reach up into No. 4, enterpriseâ€”the Qantases, the Telstras, the 
Westfields et cetera. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  Taking a small town like mine, for example, who goes out and sells the concept 
to SMEs? Is it a franchise-based model? Do you set someone up and say: 'You'll be the champion of bitcoin in 
this area. Go out and tell the world'? How does it work? I am not asking whether it is a pyramid scheme, but I am 
just interested in how you get these things started. 

Mr  Tucker:    This  is  the  public,  this  is  the  base.  It  is  the  place  from  which  this  thing  was  born,  and  the 
opportunity  that  is  recognised.  So,  as  we  said,  there  are  a  number  of  advocacy  groups,  champions  and  early 
adopters who have recognised this opportunity and are bringing it forward. The Bitcoin Association of Australia,

for example, is a great organisation, and they represent  the grassroots enthusiasts and do a lot of great work to 
promote, standardise and advocate bitcoin and bring awareness around it. And I believe that there are a few key 
representatives working out of Launceston who are driving this forward and bringing it to their local merchants in 
local towns, and this isâ€” 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  And by the way, my wife's business is thinking about signing on. 

Mr Tucker:    Fantastic. So,  your wife's business is in  Launceston, a town  that is ready to adopt bitcoin as a 
mainstream means of payment and payment processing, right through to the tops of eBay and PayPal and Google 
and the like. So between both, and everyone who falls in between, this thing is going to touch people globally, 
around the world, and it is going to do it very, very quickly. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  So, the answer to the questionâ€” 

Mr Tucker:  So, who are the interests that areâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Who are the venture capitalistsâ€” 

Senator CANAVAN:  All of these people I thinkâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  He is working his way upâ€” 

Senator CANAVAN:  Hang on: all the witnesses outlined their business interests and where they come from 
before they gave evidence this morning, just as any witness would to a Senate committee on any other  topic.  I 
know you were not here for that, Senator Heffernan, but it is on the Hansard record, andâ€” 

CHAIR:  And I do not think there is anything inappropriate or surprisingâ€”that what you have here is those 
within  the  industry  coming  to  government  and  saying,  'We  want  to  actually  be  able  to  grow  our  industry  in 
Australia, and can we find a way where we can assist government in getting the balance right between meeting 
the regulatory challenges and all the questions that we have and at the same time find a way that does not put an 
unnecessary  burden  on  the  industry?'  It  is  about  getting  that  balance  right.  I  think  Ms  Boring  outlined  it  very 
eloquently in her previous evidence. I think it is a fair summary of what you were sayingâ€”that you have to get 
the balance right between making sure you put a regulatory framework in place that assists business and assists 
government without stifling it. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  I apologise that I was not here. You are traders in bitcoin, I take it. 

Mr Tucker:  Correctâ€”well, two of us are. 

Ms Boring:  Perhaps I could make a statement on this as well. I personally do not have any investment in this 
space. I own bitcoin, but I am not an investor, and I do not own equity in any of the companies operating in this 
space  or  any  of  the  companies  who  are  a  member  of  our  organisation.  And  I  personally  am  involved  in  this 
because  I  believe  in  the  potential  benefits  this  technology  can  bring  to  society.  And  when  you  ask,  'Who  is 
invested in this, and who is going to benefit from this?' the biggest opportunity for block chain technology is for 
small businesses and consumers and the un- and under-banked population. Here in the United States over 50 per 
cent  of  our  population  does  not  have  a  bank  account  or  is  under-banked.  There  is  a  huge  opportunity  to  bring 
financial  services  around  the  world,  and  we  are  an  extremely  small  industry  today.  The  market  capitalisation 
today is between $4 billion and $5 billionâ€”tiny; we are very, very tiny. That is why it is important that we have 
this conversation now. I absolutely applaud what the Senate of Australia is doing by having conversations about 
such a small industry. The potential benefit is very large. Few people are involved, but it potentially could enable 
billions of populations around the world to have access to financial services. We believe that it can increase the 
standard of living. 

Senator WHISH-WILSON:  I do not want anyone to misconstrue my questions, because I am not in any way 
putting a negative slant on it. I am looking for where the drivers of the success of bitcoin will come from. I get 
that it is cool. I get that it has got some advantages that may need to be pitched the right way et cetera. I just want 
to see where the momentum for this to succeed is going to come from. Unfortunately,  I did not  get to hear the 
answer  to  my  questionâ€”I  had  to  go  off  to  a  division  in  the  Senate.  I  do  have  a  concern  about  competing 
currencies because the barriers to entry are very low. The first-mover advantage is the only thing I heard which 
makes  sense.  In  light  of  my  question  on  the  drivers,  how  quickly  can  you  get  there  with  your  first-mover 
advantage before another hundred currencies like this get established? 

Mr  Guzowski:    I  had  an  interesting  encounter  a  couple  of  days  ago  when  I  met  with  the  chairman  of  the 
National Online Retailers Association. He has gone from being a sceptic earlier this year to being a believer that 
this is the new technological wave. His son, who is 16 years old, is mining bitcoin and has been for a year. I think 
that  is  a  huge  insight  into  who  is  driving  this  technology.  We  have  children,  teenagers,  around  the  world  who,

because  they  have  a  curious  thirst  for  knowledge  and  for  innovative  products,  are  now  starting  to  pioneer  and 
champion this technology. 

We have had $295 million of venture capital investment in bitcoin related businesses this year. In Australia we 
have had less than $1 million invested in this space this year. In the US there is a thriving venture capital industry. 
There  is  a  burgeoning  venture  capital  industry  in  Australia  as  well.  However,  most  of  the  investment  has  been 
private  investment  because  there  is  not  a  clear  regulatory  framework  here.  With  Australia  being  so 
institutionalised, particularly the financial space, everybody is very hands-off until there is a clear framework for 
the technology and for the industry, because investors are scared about getting their hands burnt. 

CHAIR:  Are you saying: the lack of framework clarity is stifling the opportunity for people to invest because 

they are scared to invest? 

Mr  Guzowski:    I  am  a  strong  believer  in  that,  and  I  have  heard  that  from  many  investors.  The  lack  of 
regulatory framework or regulatory oversight is one of the key drivers for lack of investment in this space. Like 
any  business,  this  industry  needs  resources  to  finance  very  smart,  expensive  people  in  Australia  to  stay  and 
innovate here, where Australia can reap the benefits from it. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  You need to work out whether it is a bag of wheat or a coin. 

CHAIR:  That is one of the key issues that we have to consider. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  You did not answer my original question: who are your venture capitalists? 

Mr Tucker:  We are self-funded. I can speak as to Bit Trade and I can speak as to ADCCA. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Can you give us the details of the people, not just: 'We are'. I want to know who is 

putting the money up? 

Mr Tucker:  Sure. 

CHAIR:  I think we are going off on a tangent. 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    Noâ€”if  you  want  to  know  what  is  going  on,  mate.  You  are  as  independent  as  the 
person who pays you. When Glencore sold out to ADM in Brazil, the Brazilian government, all of a sudden, said: 
'Where did the tax go?' The next thing we know, the US governmentâ€”your inland revenueâ€”disappeared in the 
derivative market: $700 million, just like that, in one transaction. When Mr Pinnerâ€”he was here and I chaired the 
inquiryâ€”got  back  to  the  United  States,  ADM  was  hit  with  a  $700  million  tax  avoidance  bill.  You  are  right:  it 
needs to be harmonised; people need to understand it. To do that, you have to answer all the questions. 

Mr Tucker:  Sure. I would be happy to answer that question. 

CHAIR:  Could you take that question on notice, Mr Tucker? 

Mr Tucker:  Sure. 

Senator CANAVAN:  What happens if people are not in the code that you are designing? What do you want 

government to do? What are you asking government to do in relation to the code? 

Mr Tucker:  We are looking for support with the proposed model that we put forward. It is based on a proven 

blueprint that has already been successful. 

Senator CANAVAN:  In thatâ€” 

Mr Tucker:  Regulators departments. 

Senator CANAVAN:  It is a voluntary code? 

Mr  Tucker:    Yes,  it  is  a  voluntary  code  in  these  early  days.  I  think  in  time  there  will  need  to  be  further 
legislation as we have seen previously with the likes of APCA. But we start now with a few small, nimble, agile 
steps, have conversations like this and can be positioning ourselves to reap benefits in the billions of dollars for 
decades to comeâ€”or we could miss out. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Can I ask a question of our US friends? Do you think there is a risk in this? There is 
no harmonisation around the world. We are saying it is a commodity. You are saying it is currency or whatever it 
is. We are at risk because you are technically insolvent! The definition of 'sovereignty'â€”or perhaps, if we do not 
get it right, would it be the demolition of sovereignty? 

Mr Shapiro:  I do not think this is a real threat to sovereignty. Firstly, it is way too small at the moment. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  But from little things big things grow. 

Mr  Shapiro:    People  want  their  money.  It  is  simple.  People  understand  their  Australian  dollars,  their  US 
dollars and their British pound, and I think a lot of the future of this is actually going to be allowing consumers to 
hold balances in the currencies they understand and use the back end of this for payments just as merchants today

can use services. Most of the merchants in the US that accept bitcoin are not actually accepting bitcoin; they are 
using a third-party service like BitPay or Coinbase. 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    How  do  you  capture  it?  Last  year  the  United  States  Treasury  missed  on  between 
$650 billion and $800 billion through tax avoidance. How do you capture this in the revenue base if we it is not 
globally harmonised? 

Mr  Shapiro:    I  think  this  needs  to  be  worked  out  over  time  to  some  extent.  You  mentioned  earlier  the 
problems  of  collecting  sales  tax  online.  What  we  are  seeing  in  the  US  is  those  problems  are  now  going  to  be 
solved.  The  states  have  won  over  Amazon,  and  Amazon  and  most  other  major  retail  merchants  are  collecting 
sales tax on purchases. You know where the merchants are and you know who is accepting bitcoin; and, as the 
market grows, I think this will prove to be a very solvable problem. 

CHAIR:  I think it is fair to say, too, the transparency available in the block chain is actually unprecedented. It 
allows a viewing of transactions in an auditable way which is unforeseen in the existing banking sector. The way 
the block chain worksâ€”I am not  remotely an expert on this, and there are others who are far better experts on 
thisâ€” 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  So the $125 trillion of shadow banking last year, if these people would like to make 

a comment on the influenceâ€” 

CHAIR:    Here  is  the  question,  Mr  Sommer.  If,  in  a  perfect  world  which  is  not  going  to  exist,  all  foreign 
exchange types of transactions were done using bitcoin as opposed to other currencies an all transactions appeared 
on  the  block  chain  as  a  result  of  that,  if  I  am  a  regulator  or  trying  to  make  identification  of  the  movement  of 
money for taxation and other purposes, is that something I would welcome or oppose? 

Mr Sommer:  As a regulator, the amount of information that is available to you through the documentation of 
transactions  on  the  block  chain  is  unprecedented.  It  is  not  merely  a  passive  record,  but  the  way  in  which 
transactions interface with the block chain can have in them encoded tax characteristics so that the block chain 
can  distinguish  between  a  supply  that  is  a  taxable  supply  for  GST  purposes  and  a  GST-free  supply  for  GST 
purposes. That technology and that utilisation of the block chain technology is something we are just on the cusp 
of at the moment. 

CHAIR:  So is it fair to sayâ€”I want to get your wordsâ€”that, like any technology such as this, which happens 
to  be  in  the  space  of  currency,  if  we  get  the  regulation  and  framework  right,  yes,  there  potentially  is  a  risk  if 
unregulated that this becomes an avenue and a vehicle for nefarious activity; but, if we actually get it right, it has 
the potential to do the exact opposite and be a potential tool in an arsenal for regulators out there who want to 
make sure there are more transparent international transactions? 

Mr Sommer:  Yes, correct. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  That is fair enough. 

CHAIR:  On that note! 

Senator  HEFFERNAN:    Not  on  that  note.  Obviously  we  have  not  thought  through  the  definition  of 

'sovereignty' at the moment. This is without a doubt a challenge to sovereignty if we do not get it right. 

CHAIR:  We are all paired till 12:30, and the Senate bells are now ringing, which means we have to go vote. 
Thank you all for appearing. I have no idea what time it is in the US, but I want to acknowledge the special effort 
from the US witnesses to participate. 

Senator HEFFERNAN:  Seventeen hours the day before. 

CHAIR:  So I say to our American friends: we are hopeful to get ahead of you in many ways, and I note you 

are already seventeen hours behind us! Thank you. 

Committee adjourned at 12:35
